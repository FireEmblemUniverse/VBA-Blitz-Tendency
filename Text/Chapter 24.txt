## Chapter24_Opening
Following the incident at Solomon Temple,[AN]
Vedge's army begins its liberation campaign[N]
for the Unnamed Kingdom in earnest.[AN]
For the following weeks, several battles were[N]
fought between the liberation army[AN]
and the Unnamed Kingdom's knights.[AN]
However despite their best efforts,[N]
the liberation army was losing,[AN]
unable to match the raw numbers[N]
of the Unnamed Knights...[A][X]

[OpenRight][LoadVerge][OpenFarRight][LoadNull][OpenMidLeft][LoadVedge]
Gods above[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
look at all those soldiers.[A]
[OpenRight]
There's so many,[AN]
and our flanks have been cut off[N]
completely in our previous defeats[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarRight]
Is this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the end?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No! I won't let it end like this.[AN]
We must escape![A]
[OpenRight]
Verge: But to where?![N]
We are quickly running out of options![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The Northfort![A]
[OpenFarRight]
Null: What, the best-defended[N]
fort in the Unnamed Kingdom?![AN]
Surely you jest, sire?[A]
[OpenMidleft]
This is no jest, Null.[AN]
The Northfort is the most populated[N]
fort in all of the unnamed kingdom.[AN]
Attacking it sounds borderline suicidal,[N]
much more so attempting to flee there.[AN]
If my mother thinks so as well,[N]
we have our opening.[A]
[OpenRight]
This still sounds absurd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I know, but while this sounds absurd,[AN]
I believe it to be the only[N]
open path to us remaining.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?[AN]
If we're to die in battle,[N]
we may as well die with glory![A][X]

## Chapter24_Village1
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x61][0x1]
Things have been terrible[N]
since the Blitz War started.[AN]
Queen Void levied an extreme[N]
"emergency tax" on everyone,[AN]
and press-ganged anyone who could so[N]
much as hold a sword into service.[AN]
There weren't enough farmers for the[N]
harvest this year because of this,[AN]
and it looks as if the people might starve,[AN]
but what does the Queen care?[N]
She has plenty of food in reserve.[AN]
She won't feel the pain[N]
of starvation as we will,[AN]
unless we become her personal slaves![AN]
Our sole hope was that the[N]
liberation army would succeed,[AN]
but it's clear to us that[N]
they are on the verge of[AN]
being crushed by the Unnamed[N]
Knights' vast numbers[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
Oh, I shouldn't burden such[N]
kind visitors with my sorrow.[AN]
Take this; I'm sure you will[N]
get much more use of it than I.[A][X]


## Chapter24_Village2
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x60][0x1]
I can't believe this war is happening.[N]
The country turned against its own self[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
It's so horrible![N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Ugh.[AN]
My spirits may be with the rebellion but,[N]
UGH! GET AWAY FROM ME, YOU DOGS OF WAR![A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What's this?[A][X]


## Chapter24_ChapterWon
[OpenMidRight][LoadVedge]
Come on, everyone![N]
We must continue moving![A][X]
