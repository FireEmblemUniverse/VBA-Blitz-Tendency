## Ch19Ending
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
[MidLeft][LoadMystery]
[MidLeft]
Made it this far, have you?[AN]
[MidRight]
Remember your promise, Vesta![N]
You said you would tell me[AN]
everything. Speak now, lest[N]
I cut you down![AN]
[MidLeft]
You wouldn't be able to [N]
if you tried. I am a ghost,[AN]
after all.[AN]
[MidRight]
Charming. Could you[N]
get on with it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Such a gentleman...[N]
But very well; I'll start from[AN]
the beginning. I'm sure you[N]
remember the great conflict[AN]
with FEditor and the[N]
Donateenaries twenty years ago?[AN]
[MidRight]
Of course. The Donateenaries[N]
revived the Demon King FEditor[NA]
in a long-term bid to resurrect[N]
the dark god Hex. What of it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Would you believe that, a mere[N]
twenty years before that, the[AN]
Donateenaries won a similar war?[AN]
[MidRight]
What are you 
talking about?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, I see your knowledge of[N]
history matches most figments[AN]
of this world.[AN]
[MidRight]
Figments? What in the gods'[N]
names are you talking about?![AN]
[MidLeft]
I shall explain. This world[N]
is not as old as you believe[AN]
it to be. It, and many others[N]
like it were born in the[AN]
aftermath of a disastrous[N]
event on the Motherworld 78[AN]
years prior in its timeline.[N]
In this disaster, the very[AN]
fabric of reality itself was[N]
twisted, and as the threads[AN]
that held this world together[N]
were split, ethereal spheres[AN]
formed across time and space,[N]
and the aftereffects of the[AN]
power generated by this[N]
reaction created unintended[AN]
life in these spheres. As[N]
they effectively existed in[AN]
a place designed to support[N]
life, all it took was[AN]
something to kickstart that[N]
life. The Original God,[AN]
creator of all things, was[N]
initially against allowing[AN]
these life forms to exist.[N]
After all, they were formed[AN]
by the sins of mankind; no[N]
good could come of it.[AN]
However, my twin sister Ria[N]
was very much against[AN]
destroying these nascent[N]
worlds of life. She begged[AN]
for the Original God not to[N]
destroy the tiny spheres the[AN]
humans had unknowingly created.[N]
The Original God agreed on one[AN]
condition: that these[N]
â€œOutrealms", as they would come[AN]
to be called, have their lives[N]
modeled after the imaginations[AN]
of humans, with all the good[N]
and the bad that goes through[AN]
the minds of humans to be[N]
represented in the world itself.[AN]
[MidRight]
Meaning?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Meaning that whenever the human[N]
who owns a world is in a time[AN]
of happiness, their world is[N]
peaceful. Sadness is a time[AN]
of sorrow for that world's people,[N]
sickness unleashes a plague upon[AN]
it, and as you may have gathered,[N]
internal turmoil leads to war.[AN]
Always war. And as long as the[N]
human in question remains an[AN]
imperfect human, they will[N]
continue to sin, which in turn[AN]
creates more internal turmoil,[N]
which leads to more war for[AN]
that world's people...[AN]
[MidRight]
Can I stop this turmoil[N]
with the Void Medallion?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, the only way to stop war[N]
for good in these worlds is[AN]
to destroy the world itself.[N]
When the human the world is[AN]
tied to dies, the world dies[N]
with them.[AN]
[MidRight]
So all I can do is end this war?[A]
[MidLeft]
I'm afraid so...[N]
However, my sister and I both[AN]
make our own efforts to ease[N]
people's turmoil with our own[AN]
limited power, so the worlds[N]
we love may go without war longer.[AN]
[MidRight]
What are you, anyway?[N]
You clearly aren't a ghost.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ahh yes, I am what is known as[N]
an angel, a servant of the[AN]
Original God. I am here to[N]
inform you of these things,[AN]
as well as the first task you[N]
should take upon obtaining the[AN]
Void Medallion.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hehehe... Unlike a god, I am[N]
not perfect. I can very well[AN]
lie to the likes of a being[N]
below the animals humans eat.[AN]
Speak to me again after you[N]
obtain the Medallion.[AN]
I'll be waiting.[AN]
[MidRight]
Wait![A][X]
