## Ch12Beginning
[.....v][LoadVerge]
[...v..][LoadVedge]
[.....v]
It appears we've reached[N]
the famous Fort of Fight.[A]
[...v..]
Ah, I believe this is where[N]
we can fight to hone our skills.[A]
[.....v]
It'll be useful practice for[N]
when we fight our enemies.[AN]
However, the inhabitants of[N]
this fort don't go easy on[AN]
anyone who challenge it.[N]
It's life or death.[A]
[..v...][LoadCameron]
Hey, I'm Cameron. I own[N]
this fort. Wanna fight?[A]
[...v..]
Sure.[A]
[..v...]
Cool. Let's fight in the[N]
Fort of Fight, then.[A]
[.....v]
I mean, what else would[N]
we be here for?[A]
[..v...]
We do have karaoke[N]
nights here as well.[A]
[...v..]
I have no interest in such[N]
idle activities while a war[A]
is being waged. The sooner[N]
we get to the battle, the better.[A]

[v.....][LoadBojo][Invert]
...350 million...[N]
It's not too late...[AN]
To save... Bre-[A]
[Invert]

[...v..]
Uh, what's the[n]
manchild on about?[A]
[..v...]
Oh just ignore him.[N]
He's like our version of Hulk[AN]
from Ragnarok. Bojo is the[N]
strongest fighter in this fort,[AN]
being well versed in the darkest[N]
arts. Unfortunately he's a bit[AN]
behind mentally but don't[N]
underestimate him![A]
[...v..]
Very well, let's get to[N]
the fight then.[A][X]


## Ch12AfterPrep
#Put this post battle prep? Break the scene up a bit
[....v.][LoadVedge]
[.v....][LoadJet]
Hold up! Don't forget me![A]
[....v.]
Just who might you be?[a]
[.v....]
I'm Jet, a travelling bard.[N]
I'm not sure how I got here[AN]
but I feel hearing my inspiring[N]
tune will keep your knights[AN]
refreshed while you fight in[N]
this fort. My musical talent[AN]
is excellent if I say so myself.[AN]
[....v.]
I don't particularly care for[N]
your music myself but if it[AN]
helps us kill things faster[N]
then feel free to contribute[AN]
your talent to us.[AN]
[.v....]
Wonderful. Now let's get[N]
this crazy party started![A][X]

## Ch12Ending
[....v.][LoadVedge]
We have fought in the Fort[N]
of Fight. And now, we have[AN]
won. We have secured a good[N]
base from where we can search[AN]
for the Tower of the Mods.[N]
When this war is over, I can[AN]
head back here for one of[N]
Cameron's karaoke nights.[AN][X]
