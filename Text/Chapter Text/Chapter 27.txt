[.v....]
Woah![A] It seems the winds are[N]
quite strong here tonight.[A]

[....v.]
Indeed, milord.[AN]
Unusually strong even...[A]

[.v....]
What do you think?[A]

[....v.]
Could the sand dragon's seal[N]
have been broken?[A]

[.v....]
Wh-[.4] "Sand dragon"?[AN]
This is the first time that[N]
I have head of such thing.[AN]
And what would that even[N]
have to do with the wind?[A]

[....v.]
It's from a local legend, milord.[AN]
An old man living nearby told me[N]
about it.[AN]
I'd love to share it with you, but[N]
I'm afraid don't have the time.[A]

[.v....]
Right.[AN]
The wind seems to go in a clockwise[N]
rotation around the monster nest.[A]

[....v.]
Indeed.[AN]
We'd do best following it.[AN]
The clean ground will probably[N]
move in that direction as well.[A]

We're saved! Even after[N]
the Crusader God Babby[N]
himself betrayed the Queen[N]
due to her terror, her Super[N]
Blitz Lance made her on par[N]
with the Crusader God...[N]
We escaped to this village[N]
to avoid the ensuing war.[N]
Please, you must go to[N]
the Crusader God's aid![A][2NL]

"Sand dragon"?[A] Oh right,[N]
from that one tale right?[AN]
Strangely only that old man[N]
seems to actually care about it.[AN]
If I were you I wouldn't mind[N]
it too much.[A][2NL]

Anyway, take this.[A] Hopefully[N]
will it help you on your way.[A]

Those soldiers... are they...[N]
Who are they again?[AN]
I really have no idea how the[N]
lore works in all of this.[AN]
Not that it matters. We still[N]
need to deal with them...[A][2NL]

Whoever they are.[A]

[.v....]
Is that...[.5] The "sand dragon"?[AN]
But Verge! This is just a[N]
regular Zombie dragon![A]

[....v.]
Hm... Indeed it is.[AN]
Maybe that legend was just[N]
a legend after all...[A]

[.v....]
Ugh...[A] Still we need to defeat[N]
it before being able to move on.[A]

Et flash![A][2NL]

Fear not, citoyens![.4][N]
I, Deuxnids of <somewhere>, have[N]
arrived to save you from the griffes[N]
of the legendary sable dragon,[N]
creature whose power rivals none[N]
but the grand bishop of...[.6]

[....v.]
Yeah, sure, but isn't this just[N]
A regular zombie dragon?[AN]
We could have handled that[N]
ourselves without much trouble...[AN]

[.v....]
Idiots![A][2NL]

The legendaire sand dragon is[N]
no mere zombie, but a powerful[N]
creature invoqued by the ancient[N]
shamans of wind and earth...[.6]

[....v.]
Okay![A] We get it![A] Whatever.[AN]
But now that you scared it away[N]
we will need to find him again...[A]

[.v....]
Thanks...[.4] but no thanks,[N]
we can take care of it.[AN]

[....v.]
But...[.4]

[.v....]
Everyone![A] Charge the dragon![AN]
We will dispose of it quickly[N]
