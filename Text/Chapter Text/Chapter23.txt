## Chapter23_Beginning
[OpenMidRight][LoadVerge][OpenMidLeft][LoadVedge]
Verge, have our scouts seen any enemies?
[OpenMidRight]
I'm afraid so, my lord.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then why are you just now telling me this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Because with the medallion's power[N]
and the size of our ranks now,[AN]
I do believe even surprise attacks can't stop us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You idiot![AN]
Give everyone the order[N]
to take position![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, milord.[A][X]

See, Verge,[AN]
this is why even with our newfound abilities,[N]
I still need to be informed of enemy movements.[AN]
That fight would've gone much smoother[N]
had I been properly informed.[A][X]
[OpenMidRight
Yes, milord![AN]
It won't happen again![A][X]
