## Ch25Opening
Vedge runs into the Northfort with[N]
his army, expecting to fight[AN]
a huge battle with the full force[N]
of the Unnamed Kingdom's military.[AN]
When they arrive at the[N]
gate of the castle, however,[AN]
they find it open to them,[N]
without a single guard outside.[AN]
With no other options,[N]
they head inside, confused...[A][X]

## Ch25Beginning
[OpenFarLeft][LoadVerge][OpenLeft][LoadVedge]
The gates are open[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What could this mean?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I'm not sure.[AN]
The Northfort should be the hardest fort[N]
to penetrate in all of the Unnamed Kingdom,[AN]
and yet[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
We're standing right inside of it.[A]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Indeed you are.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Hmm?[AN]
Show yourself, now![A]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadMichealP][MoveMidRight]
SO, YOU MUST BE THE REBELLION[N]
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Who else would run blindly into this fort?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
A FOOL. A LUCKY ONE, THOUGH.[AN]
YOU'VE COME AT AN[N]
OPPORTUNE TIME, YOU SEE.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I'm afraid I don't recognize this man.[AN]
Or his... odd way of speaking.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I NEED YOU TO PREPARE YOURSELF[N]
FOR BATTLE. IMMEDIATELY.[AN]
AT ANY TIME, THE GATES OF THIS CASTLE[N]
WILL BE BREACHED BY THE UNNAMED KINGDOM[AN]
ONCE MORE, AND WE WILL HAVE TO MOUNT[N]
THE BEST DEFENSE WE CAN.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I still don't understand, though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
How are you the only person here?[N]
How could you manage to[N]
capture the Northfort?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
THIS FORT WAS ONCE MINE,[N]
AND I WAS ONCE OF THE UNNAMED KINGDOM.[AN]
IT WAS NOT I WHO WISHED TO[N]
BE LIKE THIS, HOWEVER.[AN]
I WAS TRAPPED, A BLOOD CONTRACT IN MY[N]
NAME BINDING ME TO THE ARMY OF THE[AN]
KINGDOM I HATED SO MUCH.[AN]
BUT NOW, I AM FREE.[AN]
FREE TO FINALLY DO WHAT I'VE[N]
DREAMED OF FOR SO LONG.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadNull]
V-Vedge, sire![AN]
Enemies at the gates![A]
[OpenMidRight]
TODAY WE FIGHT THE MIGNON[N]
APOSTLE AND HIS ARMY,[AN]
SUBJUGATED WILLINGLY UNDER THE UNNAMED[N]
KINGDOM IN SEARCH FOR MORE POWER.[AN]
AND WE WILL REIGN VICTORIOUS.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenLeft]
My ears[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]


## Ch25Turn1Event
[OpenMidRight][LoadVedge][OpenMidLeft][LoadMichealP]
MY AXE IS YOURS, VEDGE.[AN]
DO NOT LET THEM REACH THE[N]
THRONE AREA OR ANYWHERE NEAR,[AN]
OR THIS BATTLE IS GOOD AS LOST.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I understand.[AN]
Everyone, in position![A][X]
