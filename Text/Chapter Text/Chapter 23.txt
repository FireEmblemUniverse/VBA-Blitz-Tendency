[MidRight][LoadVedge]
[MidRight]
Verge, have our scouts[n]
seen any enemies?[a]
[MidLeft]
I'm afraid[n]
so, my lord.[a]
[MidRight]
Then why are you just[n]
now telling me this?[a]
[MidLeft]
Because with the medallion's[n]
power and the size of our[an]
ranks now, I do believe even[n]
surprise attacks can't stop us.[a]
[MidRight]
You idiot! Give everyone the[n]
order to take position![a]
[MidLeft]
Yes, milord.[A][X]

## Ch23Ending
[MidRight]
See, Verge, this  is why even[n]
with our newfound abilities,[an]
I still need to be informed of[n]
enemy movements. That fight[an]
would've gone much smoother[n]
had I been properly informed.[a]
[MidLeft]
Yes, milord! It[n]
won't happen again![A][X]
