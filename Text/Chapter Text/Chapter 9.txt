## Chapter9_Intro
After a detour into a marshland[N]
beset by anachronism, Vedge[AN]
heads into the core of Kagavesta[N]
Castle. The castle is quite[AN]
large, giving the invading[N]
Dominion of General ample time[AN]
to hide despite Vedge's impromptu[N]
assault. Despite this, here at[AN]
the core of the castle, this[N]
battle will end, and with its[AN]
end, Vedge will discover his[N]
destiny...[A][X]

## Chapter9_Beginning
[.v....][LoadVerge]
[.....v][LoadNull]
[...v..][LoadVedge]
We've made it this far.[N]
Who would've thought this[AN]
castle would be so overrun[N]
with Generalese troops?[A]

[.v....]
Their King led this invasion.[N]
and likely commands the[AN]
soldiers from within.[N]
Edgelard's Sensei, her father.[A]

[...v..]
A man who would condemn his[N]
daughter to death in war to[AN]
conquer Kagavesta[Beat] A man[N]
much like my own mother. Such[AN]
people cannot be allowed to[N]
exist![A]

[.....v]
Then let us punish him[N]
together, milord.[A]

[.v....]
Be careful, milord! I hear[N]
the King of General's elite[AN]
guard consists of terrors[N]
he personally tamed.[A]

[...v..]
In that case, watch out[N]
for monsters, everyone![A][X]

## Chapter9_Ending
[....v.][LoadVedge]
So ends the royal family[N]
of the Dominion of General.[A]

[.v....]
[ToggleInvert]
So you've come[Beat][A]
[ToggleInvert]

[....v.][MoveMidRight]
AAAAAAAAAAHH![N]
Who are you?!?![A]

[.v....]
[ToggleInvert]
I'm a ghost, as you can see,[N]
and ghosts have no need for[AN]
names. However, I do believe[N]
I can be of help to you. You[AN]
seek a means to cut short your[N]
mother's genocide, do you not?[A]
[ToggleInvert]

[....v.]
Even if I do, why should I[N]
trust someone who will not[AN]
tell me their name?[A]

[.v....]
[ToggleInvert]
My name is meaningless, although[N]
I suppose you do need to call[AN]
me something[Beat][.5][A]

[CloseSpeechSlow]
[.v....]
Very well, call me Jane.[A]
[ToggleInvert]

[....v.]
Miss Jane.[A]

[.v....]
[ToggleInvert]
Just Jane is fine. Anyway, you[N]
seek a means to stop your mother?[A]
[ToggleInvert]

[....v.]
Indeed. Regardless of what crimes[N]
the Donateenaries have committed[AN]
in the past, genocide is a much worse[N]
crime to visit upon them in return.[A]

[.v....]
[ToggleInvert]
I see the resolve in your eyes,[N]
but resolve alone will not allow[AN]
you to best your mother as long[N]
as she wields the Super Blitz Lance.[AN]
You need an edge, a means to[N]
challenge her on equal footing,[AN]
and the only place where you can[N]
get that is the Tower of the Mods.[A]
[ToggleInvert]

[....v.]
The great tower overlooking[N]
all of Libel[Beat][A]

[.v....]
[ToggleInvert]
The very same. At the top of[N]
the tower lies a means to[AN]
unlock your true strength:[N]
the Void Medallion.[A]
[ToggleInvert]

[....v.]
If I obtain this medallion,[N]
will I earn the strength to[AN]
defeat Mother?[A]

[.v....]
[ToggleInvert]
Indeed. Great power lies in that[N]
medallion, and only those of your[AN]
bloodline, blessed by the Crusader[N]
God Babby, only you and your mother[AN]
can use it.[A]
[ToggleInvert]

[....v.]
So it is a race then.[A]

[.v....]
[ToggleInvert]
Indeed. However, there is hope. Your[N]
mother knows of the medallion,[AN]
but not its location.[A]
[ToggleInvert]

[....v.]
I have a head start, then.[AN]
I must make haste to the[N]
Tower of the Mods![A]

[.v....]
[ToggleInvert]
... May the Crusader Gods bless[N]
your journey, chosen hero. May you[AN]
finally bring peace to this land...[A]
