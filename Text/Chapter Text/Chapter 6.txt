## Chapter6_Intro
Shaking off pursuits from his mother,[N]
Vedge heads west, to Kagavesta and[AN]
his destiny. The Kingdom of Kagavesta[N]
is a small country, said to worship[AN]
the first of the Crusader Gods and[N]
father of all things, Kaga. Known[AN]
for its devoutness, the kingdomâ€™s[N]
people sacrificed most other things[AN]
on the altar of its faith. Could such[N]
a place truly provide Vedge aid?[A][X]

## Chapter6_Beginning
[.v....][LoadVerge]
[....v.][LoadVedge]
So this is Kagavesta?[A]

[.v....]
Yes, milord, but it would appear[N]
we have uninvited guests.[A]

[....v.]
Bandits, huh? Whatever. Let's[N]
take care of them; should get us[AN]
into good graces with the locals.[A][X]

## Chapter6_LabVillage
[....v.][LoadCurrent]
Hmm[Beat] there's no one here.[AN]
I guess they wouldn't mind if[N]
I took this[Beat][A][X]

## Chapter6_RightVillage
[....v.][LoadCurrent]
[.v....][LoadFace][0x58][0x01]
The falcon is such a majestic animal,[N]
don't you think? Ah... If I were[AN]
cursed to turn into an animal, I'd be[N]
a falcon. I mean, if I could choose[AN]
which animal I became. With no choice,[N]
I'd probably end up as some sort of[AN]
lazy snake.[A][X]


## Chapter6_Ending
[.v....][LoadVerge]
[....v.][LoadVedge]
That deals with the bandits, but[N]
where are Kagavesta's knights?[AN]
Shouldn't they be here?[A]

[.v....]
Indeed, and our foes here fought[N]
not like bandits, but almost[AN]
like a foreign legion.[A]

[....v.]
Let's head to the castle.[N]
I have a bad feeling about this[Beat][A][X]
