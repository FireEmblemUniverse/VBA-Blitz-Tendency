## Chapter2_Intro
Following the defeat of the[N]
Donateenary rebels, Vedge returns[AN]
to the Nameless Capital of the[N]
Nameless Kingdom. Null's words sit[AN]
in his mind, constantly nagging[N]
at him. He is bothered; not by[AN]
the words themselves, but by the[N]
fact he cannot get them out of[AN]
his mind...[A][X]
