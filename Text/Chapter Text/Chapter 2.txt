## Chapter2_Intro
Following the defeat of the[N]
Donateenary rebels, Vedge returns[AN]
to the Nameless Capital of the[N]
Nameless Kingdom. Null's words sit[AN]
in his mind, constantly nagging[N]
at him. He is bothered; not by[AN]
the words themselves, but by the[N]
fact he cannot get them out of[AN]
his mind...[A][X]

What?! How could this be?![AN]
Vedge, secure the northern[N]

those rats.[AN]

I want you to take your forces[N]
and deal with them now.[AN]

[....v.]
Of course, Mother,[N]
but first-[A]

[.v....]
Insolent whelp![N]
Did you hear my order or not?![AN]
There's no time for your[N]
frivolous questions.[AN]
Now GET MOVING![A][X]

the Donateenary scum.[X]
