## Chapter21_Opening
Vedge has obtained the Void Medallion.[AN]
With its power in hand, he heads north,[N]
seeking the divine treasure of the Angel Ria.[AN]
This treasure, the Blitz of Aja,[N]
was previously unknown to Vedge,[AN]
but he feels no reason to doubt Vesta's claims...[A][X]

## Chapter21_Beginning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVedge][OpenMidRight][LoadVerge]
Milord, trouble afoot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What is it now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The Spritans border guard is mobilizing,[N]
and they have already made motion to attack us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Dammit, Vesta[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
She warped us too close to the border[N]
to convince them we're on their side.[AN]
No matter![AN]
We'll seize the blasted border if we have to![N]
Move![A][X]

## Chapter21_ChapterWon
[OpenMidRight][LoadNull][OpenMidLeft][LoadVedge]
We are going to regret this later, aren't we?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Not if we run like hell and[N]
leave no trace of our presence.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then let's find this "Blitz of Aja"[N]
and get out of here.[A][X]
