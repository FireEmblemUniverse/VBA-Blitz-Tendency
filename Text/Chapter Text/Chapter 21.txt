[MidRight][LoadVedge]
[MidLeft][LoadVerge]
Milord, trouble afoot.
[MidRight]
What is it now?
[MidLeft]
The Spritans border guard[n]
is mobilizing, and they[an]
have already made motion[n]
to attack us.[a]
[MidRight]
Dammit, Vesta... She warped us[n]
too close to the border to[an]
convince them weâ€™re on their[n]
side. No matter! We'll seize[an]
the blasted border if we have[n]
to! Move![A][X]

## Ch21Ending
[MidLeft][LoadNull]
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
We are going to regret[n]
this later, aren't we?[a]
[MidLeft]
Not if we run like hell and[n]
leave no trace of our presence.[a]
[MidRight]
Then let's find this "Blitz of[n]
Aja" and get out of here.[A][X]
