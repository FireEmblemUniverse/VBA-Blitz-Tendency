[OMR][LF][Vedge]
[OML][LF][Verge]
[OML]We've arrived, milord.[A]
[OMR]Yes,[.4] I'd noticed.[.4] Do[N]
you remember the plan?[A]
[OML]I remember the plan.[A]
[OMR]Tell me the plan.[A]
[OML]You politely ask for directions[N]
while I loom menacingly behind you.[A]
[OMR]And if there's any trouble?[A]
[OML]I shriek like a little girl and flee,[AN]
leaving you to the tender[N]
mercies of said trouble.[A]
[OMR]Very good.[.4] Let's go.[A][X]

## Ch14Intro2
[OFL][LF][Verge]
[OL][LF][Vedge]
[OFFR][LF][Splenda]
[OFFR][MMR]
[OMR]Why,[.4] hello there,[.4] dearies![.5] I wasn't[N]
expecting any visitors today.[A]
[OL]Good day,[.4] madam.[.4] We're travelling to the[N]
Tower of the Mods and got sidetracked,[AN]
so we were hoping you'd be able[N]
to tell us how best to reach it.[A]
[OMR]Of course,[.4] my little sugar lumps![.4] In fact,[.4][N]
I'll do one better and show you myself.[AN]
The landscape can be quite difficult[N]
to navigate if you're not a witch.[A]
[OL]That's very kind of you,[.4] madam.[.4][N]
We'd be very much obliged--[AN]
hang on,[.4] did you say witch?[A]
[OMR]Yes,[.4] dearie.[.4] I'm a--[A]
[OFL]Eek![.7][CloseSpeech][MFFL][Event][.4][OL][MML][.7]
[OMR]Er[Beat]is your friend alright?[A]
[OML]Almost certainly.[.4] I think[N]
he was just scared of you.[A]
[OMR]Oh,[.4] no need for that![.4] I'm a good witch![.4][AN]
Splenda's the name;[.4] Splenda the Sweet.[N]
I wouldn't have done anything bad to him![A]
[OML]Nice to meet you,[.4] Splenda.[.4] I'm[N]
Vedge.[.5] So[Beat]a good witch,[.4] huh?[A]
[OMR]That's right,[.4] pumpkin.[.4][N]
Licensed and everything![A]
[OML]You[Beat]have a witch license?[A]
[OMR]Yep![.4] All good witches are required[N]
to be licensed and registered.[AN]
Wicked witches are technically[N]
supposed to be card carriers too,[AN]
but,[.4] y'know,[.4] they're wicked,[.4][N]
so they don't play by the rules.[A]
[OML]So[Beat]you could,[.4] say,[.4] be a wicked witch[N]
who's pretending to be a good witch?[A]
[OMR][SlowBeat]Huh.[.4] You know,[.4] sweetie,[.4] I've[N]
never thought of it that way.[AN]
I suppose that would be possible,[.4][N]
but I assure you,[.4] I am a good witch.[A]
[OML]I believe you.[A]
[OMR]Excellent![.4] That means we[N]
can get going right away![A]
[OML]Right now?[.4] Don't you need to,[.4] uh,[.4][N]
get ready,[.4] or pack,[.4] or something?[A]
[OMR]I've already packed,[N]
as a matter of fact.[A]
[OML]That's awfully convenient.[A]
[OMR]Isn't it?[.4] I was actually planning on[N]
making the journey to the Tower myself;[AN]
I'm running low on certain ingredients.[A]
[OML][Beat][A]
[OMR]Oh,[.4] don't worry,[.4] darling.[.4] No eye of newt[N]
or fenny snake or any of that nonsense.[AN]
Us good witches aren't allowed to[N]
use such abominable ingredients;[AN]
it's against guild rules.[.4] Besides,[.4] ew![A]
[OML][SlowBeat]I see.[.5] Well,[.4] actually,[.4] I don't see,[.4][N]
but I'll take your word for it.[AN]
If you're ready to go, we'll follow.[A]
[OMR]Excellent,[.4] pumpkin.[.4] I won't fly too[N]
high or fast so you can keep up.[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][OMR][MFFR]
[OML][Beat]Fly?[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow]
[OML]Of course.[.4] She's a witch.[.4] Of course[N]
she's going to fly.[.4] How lovely.[A][X]

## Ch14Intro3
[OMR][LF][Wicky]
[OMR]SPLENDA![A][X]

## Ch14Intro4
[OMR][LF][Splenda]
[OML][LF][Vedge]
[OMR]Oh,[.4] dear.[A]
[OML]Uh,[.4] Splenda?[.4] Who is that?[A]
[OMR]That,[.4] my precious,[.4] is Wicky.[A]
[OML]Wicky?[A]
[OMR]Well,[.4] she goes by WWOANSCD--[A]
[OML]Gesundheit![A]
[OMR]--but that's really hard to say,[.4] so[N]
everyone calls her Wicky instead.[A]
[OML]Is that noise supposed[N]
to mean something?[A]
[OMR]It stands for "Wicked Witch Of A[N]
Non-Specific Cardinal Direction".[AN]
The poor thing was set on being[AN]
a wicked witch, but all the good[N]
names were already taken.[A]
[OML]Wicked witch!?[A]
[OMR]Yes,[.4] love.[.4] Extremely wicked.[.4][N]
She's here to kill me.[AN]
That's one of the reasons[N]
I was already packed.[A]
[OML]I see.[.4] I don't suppose it's not[N]
too late to,[.4] uh,[.4] not be here?[AN]
Hide?[.4] Run away?[.4] Teleport?[A]
[OMR]No,[.4] dearie.[.4] I never was much[N]
good at teleporting class.[AN]
I couldn't even warp myself,[N]
much less all of you.[AN]
I'm afraid we're going to have to[N]
face her,[.4] and almost certainly[AN]
die horribly in the attempt.[A]
[OML]But[Beat] but[Beat] I'm on a mission![.4][N]
I can't die now![.4] We'll fight her![A]
[OMR]Oh,[.4] honey.[.4] I admire your bravery,[.4] but[N]
she's way too strong for any of us.[A][X]

## Ch14Intro5
[OMR][LF][Wicky]
[OMR]That's right,[.4] little Splenda![.4] You and your[N]
band of misfits can't hope to defeat me![AN]
In fact,[.4] I'm so powerful,[.4] I think I'll[N]
just let my familiars slaughter you![A][X]

## Ch14Intro6
[OMR][LF][Splenda]
[OML][LF][Vedge]
[OMR]Oh,[.4] my[Beat][A]
[OML]Did she make those things?[A]
[OMR]Yes[Beat] I hadn't realized she was so[N]
strong.[.4] This is serious dark magic.[A]
[OML]Well,[.4] let's kill those things instead.[.4][N]
Maybe that'll make her go away.[A]
[OMR]I doubt it,[.4] cupcake.[.4][N]
Although[Beat]perhaps[Beat][A]
[OML]Hmm?[A]
[OMR]It must take an awful lot of energy,[.4][N]
summoning that many creatures at once.[AN]
[ToggleRed]Perhaps,[.4] if she keeps raising them,[.4][N]
she will grow weaker.[ToggleRed][.4][A] I suggest not[N]
going near her too quickly,[.4] however.[A]
[OML]Right. I'll let the rest know.[A][X]

## Ch14End
[OMR][LF][Splenda]
[OML][LF][Vedge]
[OML]Ding dong,[.4] the witch is dead![A]
[OMR]Alas,[.4] poor Wicky.[.4] I knew her,[.4] Vedge,[.4] a woman[N]
of infinite cruelty and,[.4] uh,[.4] not much else.[A]
[OML]'Alas'?[.4] Sounds more like[N]
'Good riddance' to me![A]
[OMR]Yes,[.4] well,[.4] a good witch shouldn't[N]
revel in the loss of human life.[AN]
Even an irredeemable pile of garbage[N]
like her.[.4] It's in the code of conduct.[A]
[OML]Er[SlowBeat]Right[SlowBeat][A]
[OMR]Anyway,[.4] enough mourning,[.4] darling.[N]
Are you ready to continue onwards?[A]
[OML]Yes.[.4] Let's go![A][X]
