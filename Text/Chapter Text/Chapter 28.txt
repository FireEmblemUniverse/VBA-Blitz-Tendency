## Ch28Narration
Dawn breaks on a new day,[n]
a day much like any other.[an]
However, on this day, the[n]
final showdown of this long[an]
war begins. The Crusader[n]
God Babby, the original[an]
founder of the Unnamed[n]
Kingdom, stands in rebellion[an]
to Vedge's mother and enemy,[n]
Void, and has secured the[an]
castle. Vedge's best chance[n]
is to meet up in the castle[an]
with the Crusader God himself[n]
to take over the capital.[an]
However, Void has prepared[n]
for this possibility, and[an]
has summoned four knights[n]
of unparalleled strength[an]
and power. These knights[n]
known as the Lords of Light[an]
and Shadow, are the finest[n]
in all lands, and pose a[an]
great threat to Vedge.[n]
Can Vedge win?[an][X]

The unnamed capital...[an]
I'm coming, mother.[n]
Coming to put an end to this.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Milord, our scouts have returned.[n]
They've confirmed that while the[an]
castle is completely surrounded[n]
by the Lords of Light and Shadow,[an]
the castle itself is under the[a]
control of the Crusader God Babby.[an]
[Left]
It is? 
Don't tell me we have to fight[n]
one of the Crusader Gods?![an]
[FarLeft]
No, the Crusader God stands[n]
against Queen Void. He is an ally.[an]
[MidRight]
Are you serious?[a]
[FarLeft]
Yes, and he seeks to provide[n]
his strength to you sire, but[an]
he cannot do that without[n]
meeting you directly.[an]
[MidRight]
So we move to the castle.[a]
[FarLeft]
Yes, and as quickly as possible.[a]
[MidRight]
Even so, there may be some things[n]
we can get done out here before[an]
we [Red]visit the castle.[Red][n]
I have a feeling we won't get[an]
another chance once we do so.[an]
[FarLeft]
Indeed. There may be something[n]
very important here, but if we[an]
go to the castle now, any[n]
chance we we had at obtaining[an]
it will be lost.[an][X]

Final Fantasy! You're safe![n]
Now I can join Vedge's army,[an]
but... hmm... I doubt the[n]
others will join even if[an]
their kids are saved for[n]
balancing reasons.[an][X]

Metal Gear! How many times have[n]
I told you! I'm tired of working[an]
on you! You don't have to be my[n]
child anymore! Ugh. I guess I'll[an]
join Vedge's army now. Not like[n]
I have anything else to do.[a][X]

Alright, alright. You've[n]
convinced me. I'll fight[an]
for you. Although, this[n]
means none of the others[an]
will join you. Here,[n]
have some pizza; it'll[an]
cheer you up. What do[n]
you mean, it won't?[an]
It's better than nothing,[n]
[MidRight]No.[A]
[MidLeft]
Now listen here, you little[n]
ingrate. Do you know why[n]
you don't appreciate this[n]
pizza? It's because the[n]
pizza industry is finished[n]
and you refuse to open your[n]
eyes to this fact! I went[n]
to the calzone industry[n]
convention last year, and[n]
all the calzone makers were[n]
putting out new calzones with[n]
interesting new flavors while[n]
the pizza industry still[n]
remains stuck in its old[n]
ways! The pizza industry[n]
needs to open itself to[n]
innovation or die, and mark[n]
my words, you pizza people[n]
are running out of time.[n]
A decade from now, you'll[n]
all be history and the[n]
calzone people are going[n]
to be dancing on your[n]
grave... PIZZA'S grave![n]
MARK! MY! WORDS![A][X]

So you made it.[a]
[MidRight]
My Lord. I thank[n]
you for rebelling.[a]
[MidLeft]
It is fine. Now let us secure[n]
the town proper. This battle[an]
is not over yet.[a]
[MidRight]
Of course![A][X]
