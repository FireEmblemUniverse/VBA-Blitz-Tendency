## Ch30Narration
The Final Battle begins atop[n]
the forbidden peak overlooking[an]
the bloodsoaked capital of the[n]
Forbidden Kingdom. On this day,[an]
nearly three years from the day[n]
the bloody [0x93]War of Oblivion[0x94][an]
#fancy quotes
started, the war will finally[n]
come to an end...[a][X]


## Ch30Opening
[FarLeft][LoadFace][0x04][0x01]
#Leeroy
[Left][LoadVoid]
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
Mother! We settle[n]
this here![a]
[Left]
Vedge, you have come a long way.[n]
If you weren't attempting to[an]
kill me, I would be proud of[n]
you... I never would have[an]
expected to need to assemble[n]
my old army anew to fight off[an]
my own flesh and blood.[an]
[MidRight]
Mother... I...[n]
Let's do this...[a]
[Left]
Hmph. Leeroy,[n]
are you ready?[a]
[FarLeft]
Indeed, my love.[n]
Let's put our[an]
greatest mistake[n]
out of its misery![a]
[Left]
EVERYONE, WE FIGHT![a]
[MidRight]
EVERYONE, TOGETHER[n]
WE RIDE! TO VICTORY![an][X]


## Ch30PacifistEnding
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
[MidLeft][LoadVoid]
My son... Why won't[n]
you attack?[A]
[MidRight]
Mother... Let's stop this[n]
fighting. I understand now.[an]
I'll become the next Blitz[n]
and stamp out that filthy[an]
Donateenary trash...[n]
Nobody else needs to die...[AN]
#Stamp what? The doc cut it off. Oh well, it's adlib time.
[X]

## Ch30NormalEnding
#(MGS3 Ending Theme plays in background)
#throw that on the list of midis i suppose
[Left][LoadNull]
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
... It's over.[a]
[MidLeft]Vedge...
[MidRight]
Null, I'm leaving.[AN]
Do me a favor and tell Verge[n]
I leave this kingdom to him.[a]
[MidLeft]
But it's your birthright,[N]
Vedge! You-[A]
[MidRight]
I'm damn well aware of my[n]
birth! After all, my mother[an]
just died because of it.[n]
How can I rule this kingdom[an]
when I played a large part[n]
in dragging it all to hell?[an]
[MidLeft]
So where are you heading?[a]
[MidRight]
I haven't a clue...[an]
Probably somewhere I can be[n]
alone for a while. With any[an]
luck, the winner of this war[n]
not seizing power may be[an]
enough to prevent the cycle[n]
from repeating.[an]
[MidLeft]
I understand your reasoning. I[n]
don't like it, but I understand.[a]
[MidRight]
Let us never forget this war,[n]
Null; it is the greatest[an]
tragedy ever to befall this[n]
world. We must strive to make[an]
Libel a better place. As it[n]
has been said, and as it shall[an]
be said... ultimate power[n]
ultimately corrupts.[an]
#(Sound of blade hitting ground [dunno about this; this is pretty hard to depict in GBA sound effects alone]) 
And because of this, I vow[n]
never to use this power again.[an]
I hereby renounce my birthright,[n]
and with it the ability to make[an]
war! Never again shall I pick up[n]
this axe! No more violence...[an]
No more tears. Together, we[n]
shall create our own bright future![an]
#THE END
