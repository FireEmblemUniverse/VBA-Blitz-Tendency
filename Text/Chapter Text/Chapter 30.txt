## Ch30Narration
The Final Battle begins atop 
the forbidden peak overlooking
the bloodsoaked capital of the
Forbidden Kingdom. On this day,
nearly three years from the day
the bloody “War of Oblivion” 
started, the war will finally
come to an end…

[NearLeft][LoadVoid]
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
Mother! We settle[n]
this here![a]
[NearLeft]
Vedge, you have come a long way.[n]
If you weren’t attempting to[an]
kill me, I would be proud of[n]
you... I never would have[an]
expected to need to assemble[n]
my old army anew to fight off[an]
my own flesh and blood.[an]
[MidRight]
Mother... I...[n]
Let’s do this...[a]
[NearLeft]
Hmph. Leeroy,[n]
are you ready?[a]
[FarLeft]
Indeed, my love.[n]
Let’s put our[an]
greatest mistake[n]
out of its misery![a]
[NearLeft]
EVERYONE, WE FIGHT![a]
[MidRight]
EVERYONE, TOGETHER[n]
WE RIDE! TO VICTORY![an][X]


## Ch30PacifistEnding
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
[MidLeft][LoadVoid]
My son... Why won’t[n]
you attack?[A]
[MidRight]
Mother... Let’s stop this[n]
fighting. I understand now.[an]
I’ll become the next Blitz[n]
and stamp out that filthy[an]
Donateenary trash...[n]
Nobody else needs to die...[AN][X]
#Stamp what? The doc cut it off. Oh well, it's adlib time.

## Ch30NormalEnding

#throw that on the list of midis i suppose
[NearLeft][LoadNull]
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
... It’s over.[a]
[MidLeft]Vedge...
[MidRight]
Null, I’m leaving.[AN]
Do me a favor and tell Verge[n]
I leave this kingdom to him.[a]
[MidLeft]
But it’s your birthright,[N]
Vedge! You-[A]
[MidRight]
I’m damn well aware of my[n]
birth! After all, my mother[an]
just died because of it.[n]
How can I rule this kingdom[an]
when I played a large part[n]
in dragging it all to hell?[an]
[MidLeft]
So where are you heading?[a]
[MidRight]
I haven’t a clue...[an]
Probably somewhere I can be[n]
alone for a while. With any[an]
luck, the winner of this war[n]
not seizing power may be[an]
enough to prevent the cycle[n]
from repeating.[an]
[MidLeft]
I understand your reasoning. I[n]
don’t like it, but I understand.[a]
[MidRight]
Let us never forget this war,[n]
Null; it is the greatest[an]
tragedy ever to befall this[n]
world. We must strive to make[an]
Libel a better place. As it[n]
has been said, and as it shall[an]
be said... ultimate power[n]
ultimately corrupts.[an]
#(Sound of blade hitting ground [dunno about this; this is pretty hard to depict in GBA sound effects alone]) 
And because of this, I vow[n]
never to use this power again.[an]
I hereby renounce my birthright,[n]
and with it the ability to make[an]
war! Never again shall I pick up[n]
this axe! No more violence...[an]
No more tears. Together, we[n]
shall create our own bright future![an][X]
