[OL]What is this place?[A]
[OR]These are the ruins of Aquilet,[.4] dear.[AN]
We have to pass through them on our way[N]
to the Tower of the Mods.[.4] Pretty,[.4] eh?[A]
[OFL]Not really. They're[Beat]ruined.[A]
[OL]Pah![.4] You have no appreciation[N]
for fine architecture,[.4] Verge.[A]
[OFL]As you say,[.4] milord.[A]
[OL]Why,[.4] just look at the clean lines,[.4][N]
the proportionality,[.4] the[SlowBeat]er[SlowBeat]uh[Beat][AN]
Actually,[.4] I can't say this with a straight[N]
face.[.4] Verge is right.[.4] It looks awful.[A]
[OFL]Thank you for your revised opinion of[N]
my architectural critiques,[.4] milord.[A]
[OL]You're quite welco--[.4][N]
hang on,[.4] what's that?[A]

[OR][MFL][ClearFace][OFL][LF][Splenda][.5]
[OFL]Umm[Beat][A]
[OL]Friend of yours?[A]
[OFL]I[Beat]don't think so?[A]
[OFR]Splenda![.4] It's me,[.4] Zane![.4] You nursed me[N]
back to health last year after I[AN]
was set upon by a pack of gargoyles.[A]
[OFL]Oh,[.4] my.[.4] Yes,[.4] I do remember you![AN]
But what happened?[.4] You look[N]
a tad[SlowBeat]malnourished, pumpkin.[A]
[OFR]I fell afoul of a curse in these ruins,[.4][AN]
locking my soul into my body even[N]
as it disintegrated around me.[A]
[OFL]Oh no![.4] Is there anything[N]
I can do for you,[.4] cupcake?[A]
[Event]
[OFR]Well[Beat][A]

[Event]
[OFR]OI! GET BACK HERE![A]
[OL]Er[Beat]did a dog monster just[N]
run off with your foot?[A]
[OFR]Yes![.4] Along with my tibia[N]
and my middle phalanges![A]
[OFL]Oh,[.4] no![.4] Does it hurt?[A]
[OFR]Not[Beat]really?[.4] Kind of?[.4] I don't really[N]
know how to describe it.[.4] It tingles.[A]
[OL]My solemn condolences.[A]
[OFL]Oh,[.4] but we must[N]
help Zane,[.4] Vedge![A]
[OL][Beat]We do?[.4] I mean,[.4] we're kind of in a[N]
hurry to get to the Tower of the Mods[Beat][AN]
Besides,[.4] what exactly do[N]
you expect us to do--[.7][CloseSpeech]
[OFL][MFFL]
[OL]--Dammit,[.4] she's gone.[A][CloseSpeech]
[Event]
[OL]Oh,[.4] come ON![.4] Do we have to[N]
fight everything from here[AN]
to the ends of the earth before[N]
we can finally get the Tower?[A]
[OMR]Probably.[A]
[OL]You[Beat]are these creatures your doing?[A]
[OMR]No.[.4] The ruins are[Beat]unquiet.[N]
I'm afraid I do not know why.[A]
[OL]Oh,[.4] I know why.[.4] It's because the universe[N]
wants me to get enough exercise.[A]
[OMR]Really?[A]
[OL]No.[.4] Now stay put while we get your bones[N]
back.[.4] Well, not that you have much choice.[A]
[OMR]Right.[.4] Thanks.[A][X]

[OMR]Skeleton magic,[.4] of course![A]
[OML]I see.[A][CloseSpeech]
[OML][MFFL]
[OMR]Which,[.4] in this case,[.4][N]
is duct tape.[A][X]

creature with thoughts and feelings.[A]
[OMR]Well,[.4] excuuuuuse me,[.4] Princess![A]
[OFL]Arf arf yap![A]
[OL]You know,[.4] darling,[.4] I'd say he's[N]
quite justified being angry,[AN]
considering you ate his finger.[A]

you out of your mind,[.4] Splenda?[A]
[OML][Beat][A]
[OMR]Um[Beat]I'm sorry for yelling at you[Beat][N]
Please don't turn me into a newt.[A]
[OML]It's fine.[.4] But[Beat]I'm afraid Zane's bones[N]
were crushed when the hound was slain.[A]
[OMR]Oh.[A]
[OML]I feel[Beat]I have to help Zane.[A]
[OMR]Uh[Beat]why?[A]
[OML]I was taught to help[N]
those in need, darling.[A]

need of your services,[.4] too.[A]
[OML]True.[.4] I can give you directions to the[N]
Tower;[.4] the best path is not far from here.[AN]
However,[.4] I shall remain here.[.4] I'm sorry.[A]
[OMR]Very well.[.4] I'll respect your wishes.[A]
[OML]Thank you. Now, you'll want to...[A][X]

## BennyDies2
Vedge receives directions to the Tower[N]
of the Mods, and promptly forgets them.[AN]
Fortunately, Splenda is willing to write[N]
them down. They bid each other farewell[N]
and safe travels, and Vedge sets off.[A][X]
