At last, you've made it to[N]
the top of the tower.[AN]
[MidRight]
Indeed.[N]
I feel it... Crawling in my skin,[AN]
my holy blood... It calls to me.[N]
Can I handle the weight of this[AN]
power? The raw Aegir, the pure[N]
quintessence, the unmatched ether[AN]
of the great Crusader God Babby.[N]
My power was already great, but[AN]
were I to use this... This is[N]
to go even further beyond!![AN]
#Plot promote here!
Now give me my medallion[N]
and explain my next goal.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Very well, but before I do,[N]
know this. The Void Medallion,[AN]
Water Crest, Earth Sigil,[N]
all of these items meant to[AN]
unlock the power passed down[N]
through each bloodline, they[AN]
were sealed here for good[N]
reason. Ultimate power[AN]
ultimately corrupts, after[N]
all, and while using[AN]
this medallion will give[N]
you more than enough power[AN]
to stand on equal footing[N]
with your mother, doing so[AN]
will inevitably cause you[N]
to one day become as evil[AN]
as her.[AN]
[MidRight]
... Can I defeat my[N]
mother without it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
None can say. Your odds of[N]
success are substantially[AN]
lower without using the [N]
medallion's power. I will[AN]
say they are greater than[N]
zero, but still abysmally low.[AN]
[MidRight]
And if I use this power,[N]
someone will one day need[AN]
to stop me?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yes. The next time turmoil[N]
erupts in the heart of the[AN]
human who is connected to[N]
this world, there is no[AN]
doubt you will be the aggressor.[AN]
[MidRight]
I see...[N]
Can I take the medallion[AN]
now without using it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yes. Keep it with you,[N]
and think on whether or[AN]
not you must call upon[N]
its power.[AN]
[MidRight]
What should I do now that[N]
I have the Medallion?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Go to the Republic of Spritans[N]
in the far north and seek the[AN]
Blitz of Aja. The combined[N]
might of the Void Medallion[AN]
and the Blitz of Aja will [N]
give you the greatest chance[AN]
of success against Void. You[N]
will find the Blitz of Aja in[AN]
possession of my sister, Ria.[AN]
[MidRight]
Very well.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I shall warp you to the border[N]
of the Republic. The fate of[AN]
the world is in your hands,[N]
Vedge; a great battle for the[AN]
fate of all Libel awaits you.[A][X]
