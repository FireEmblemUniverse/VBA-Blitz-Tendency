## Ch11Narration
Kagavesta's cities are occupied[N]
by the forces of the Unnamed[AN]
Kingdom, complete with a blockade[N]
of Kagavesta's ports. Vedge[AN]
quickly realizes that his mother[N]
knows the secret in the[AN]
Tower of the Mods. Without a[N]
personal ship to break the[AN]
blockade, Vedge scrambles to find[N]
another way to reach Donator[AN]
Island, where the Tower of[N]
the Mods resides...[A][X]
 
## Ch11Opening
[.v....][LoadVerge]
[....v.][LoadVedge]
Verge, what do you[N]
think of my plan?[AN]
[.v....]
Pardon my bluntness, milord,[N]
but I think this is crazy.[AN]
Assaulting the Fort of Fight[N]
is a ludicrous idea![AN]
[....v.]
Under any other circumstances,[N]
I'd agree. Unfortunately, however,[AN]
the underground passage in that[N]
fort is our only means of accessing[AN]
Donator Island without obtaining a[N]
ship and running the blockade,[AN]
and to be frank, we have better[N]
odds taking this fortress than we[AN]
do defeating the Unnamed Navy with[N]
a single ship.[AN]
[.v....]
I[Beat] Very well, milord. While[N]
our plan is not ironclad, [AN]
it is preferable to fending[N]
off a hundred ironclad frigates.[AN]
I will give the order to attack.[AN][X]

[OML]
Hold! Are you Lord Vedge[N]
of the Unnamed Kingdom?[AN]
[OMR]
I am.[N]
[OML]
Please, you must help me[N]
save my sister![AN]
[OMR]
Who are you?[AN]
[OML]
My name is Luut. My sister,[N]
Doot, fights for your mother.[AN]
I have been looking for her,[N]
only to be led away from her[AN]
for too long and witness her[N]
brainwashing at the hands of[AN]
your mother... Please, you[N]
must allow me to join you so[AN]
I can put her out of her misery.[A]
[OMR]
Fine by me.[N]
The more, the merrier![A]
[OML]
One more thing...[A]
[OMR]
Huh?[A]
[OML]
If you see Doot, kill her.[N]
Do not hesitate.[A]
[OMR]
Kill... your sister?[A]
[OML]
In the state she is[N]
currently in, if you[AN]
don't, you are already dead.[A][X]


## Ch11Ending
[OMR][LoadVedge]
Now that we've secured this[n]
smaller fort, we can move on[AN]
to the Fort of Fight proper.[n]
Let's go![a][X]
