[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][Fanni][0x01]
Mr. Ersatz, can I take[N]
my hand off my chin now?[.][A][0x2]
My arm's gettin' sore...[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Young Fanni, don't you[N]
remember what I told you?[.][AN]
Maintaining a pensive[.][N]
posture whenever possible[AN]
vastly improves mental strength,[.][N]
character, digestion, arm muscles...[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I know! But we've been sittin'[.][N]
here for who-knows-how-long[AN]
and nothing's happened! [.]Look,[.][N]
I'll just go mash that guy over[AN]
there like a potato and we'll[N]
be able to get outta here![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
I entrusted you with the sacred[N]
Tablet of Celerity, the precious[AN]
treasure of the Peatmoss Clan,[.][N]
and now you throw your life away?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I mean... [....]I [.]did already[N]
use it and all, [.]so...[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
The machinations of Dennis[N]
are not to be taken lightly![.][AN]
If you try to just "go mash him",[.][N]
you'll fall right into his trap![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Mr. Ersatz, the only trap here[N]
is these dumb tiles! [.]The longer[.][AN]
I sit here, the more I think you're[N]
overestimating this Dennis guy![.][A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Dennis is not just some "guy".[.][N]
He's the brains behind an empire![AN]
If we play this dangerous game[N]
into which he's trying to lure us,[.][AN]
we'll only be playing right into[N]
the blackheart's hands.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
PUH-lease, Mr. Ersatz.[.][N]
Blackheart, blackfart![.][A][0x2][ToggleSmile]
Watch this! I'll speed right[N]
through and come back with[AN]
that old Dennis's dragon-[N]
murderin' hide on this spear![A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight]
Nyooooooom![.][A][CloseSpeechSlow]

## ChEightIntroTwo
[OpenRight][LoadFace][Dennis][0x01]
That old fool is getting worried...[N]
He's trying to speed things up![.][A][0x2]
Soon, the destruction of the[N]
central manakete tribes shall[AN]
be complete! All who refuse to[N]
submit to the Empire must die![.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace][X]

## ChEightIntroThree
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][Ersatz][0x1]
Oh no... This fog...! [.]We've fallen[N]
into one of Dennis's traps![.][AN]
If only we had backup...[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x02][0x01]
Hello.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Gods above![N]
We're saved![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You look like you've been fighting.[N]
What's the situation here?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
I am Ersatz, sole survivor of[N]
the Peatmoss Clan. [.]This[AN]
marshland was once my home,[.][N]
but in years past, it's been[AN]
transformed into a twisted playground[N]
for that damnable general, Dennis![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Peatmoss...[....][N]
!!![.][AN]
Are you an Earth Dragon?![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Earth?[N]
Oh, heavens, no.[.][AN]
We had a falling-out with the Earth[N]
Dragon Tribe some 1473 years ago.[.][AN][CloseEyes]
I remember it like it was yesterday.[.][A][OpenEyes][0x2]
But never mind that! Your arrival[N]
couldn't be more auspicious.[.][AN]
You see, I came here to reclaim[N]
the lands of my childhood[.][AN]
in the company of a young knight[N]
who swore herself to my protection.[.][AN]
So little did I know of Dennis's[N]
treachery, he's trapped us within[AN]
a mystical fog![.] I beseech you,[.][N]
go to her aid, and I shall stay[AN]
here to guard the surroundings[N]
and warn you of any other tricks.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Why can't you rescue her[.][N]
yourself? Aren't you a dragon?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
I am, but Dennis is an[N]
exterminator of dragons![.][AN]
His bodyguards are equipped with[N]
weapons that pierce scales easily.[.][A][0x2]
I beg of you, help us put an end[N]
to the mad rampage of Dennis,[.][AN]
and all my draconic power and[N]
wisdom are yours to command.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
If this Dennis is as fearsome[N]
as you speak of him to be,[.][AN]
chances are I would've had to[N]
fight him sooner or later anyway.[AN]
I, Vedge, will bring him to justice![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Thank you, Master Vedge![.][A][0x2]
[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Ah, there's one more[N]
thing you should know.[.][AN]
I have a certain... [....]eye for[N]
the battlefield. [.]You might[AN]
describe it as being able to[N]
see things before they happen.[.][AN]
If I sense something is amiss,[N]
I'll be sure to let you know.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Understood.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][X]

Those fools! They've fallen[N]

No self-respecting lordling can[N]

and now they'll pay the[N]

[OpenRight]
The bag of money... disappeared?![.][AN]
Blast it all, Ersatz! We really[N]
could've used that, you know.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That was no bag of gold, milord![N]
It was a bag full of scorpions![.][AN]
Didn't you see it squirming?[.][A]
[OpenRight]
No... In fact, I thought I heard[N]
the jingling of gold coins inside...[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then it's a good thing I was[N]
here to save you, milord![.][AN]
[OpenRight]
Well, whatever the case,[N]
Dennis now lies deep in the mud.[.][AN]
Feel free to spend the rest of[N]
the day doing whatever it is[.][AN]
you need to do here. We[N]
continue moving tomorrow.[.][A]

Yes, Master Vedge.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace][X]

Mr. Ersatz![.][N]
Isn't this great?[.][A][ToggleSmile]

It is not "great", Fanni, that you[N]

absolutely no heed to my warnings![N]
You must be more disciplined![.][A]

Sorry, Mr. Ersatz... I'll try[N]

great that we've got help now?[.][A]
