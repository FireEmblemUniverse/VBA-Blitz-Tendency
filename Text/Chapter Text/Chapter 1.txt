## Chapter1_Intro
In a time long past, the gods[N]
themselves walked these lands.[AN]
Our continent of Libel was[N]
home to several, the Crusader[AN]
Gods. These gods taught man the[N]
powers of making and unmaking,[AN]
but with their power came a[N]
destructive being. This being,[AN]
originally known as Ztilb, took[N]
many forms and brought great[AN]
destruction upon our continent.[N]
However, his body was always[AN]
destroyed by a hero carrying a[N]
weapon blessed by one of the[AN]
Crusader Gods, bringing about[N]
a brief era of peace known[AN]
as the "New Day". Vedge is[N]
the son of Void, the hero queen[AN]
who brought about the New Day[N]
Libel during which Vedge currently[AN]
lives. Little does Vedge know,[N]
this era of peace is soon to end...[A][X]

## Chapter1_Beginning
[....v.][LoadVedge]
[.v....][LoadVerge]

[....v.]
So the Donateenary rebels have[N]
based themselves here.[A]

[.v....]
Indeed. In their desperation after[N]
the fall of FEditor, it seems these[AN]
Donateenaries have become nothing[N]
more than a group of pirates.[AN]
And as pirates, they have made life[N]
a living hell for the poor, unnamed[AN]
kingdom residents living here.[A]

[....v.]
Pitiful. For what purpose should we save[N]
these people who cannot save themselves?[AN]

[.v....]
It is a knight's duty, milord.[A]

[....v.]
Fie on that, but as long as there[N]
are enemies here, I may as well[AN]
use them for training.[A][X]

## Chapter1_Ending
[....v.][LoadVedge]
Pitiful, if you can't pay my mother's[N]
taxes, just get another job.[AN]
Money is easy enough to come by.[A]

[.v....][LoadNull]
Vedge...[A]

[....v.]
What is it, Null?[A]

[.v....]
Are you not at all bothered by this?[AN]
These people were driven to war[N]
by your mother's oppression...[A]

[....v.]
Do you have something[N]
to say to me, Null?[A]

[.v....]
Look Vedge, I owe your family a lot.[N]
Your mother took me and my sister in,[AN]
commoners no less, after our parents[N]
were killed in the War of Blitz.[AN]
We were raised as your siblings,[N]
and I've never forgotten[AN]
my gratitude to your family.[AN]
Even so, I've also never forgotten[N]
my heritage as a commoner.[AN]
Even after my sister Nada[N]
accepted your marriage proposal,[AN]
truly making us nobility,[N]
I have not forgotten my heritage.[A]

[....v.]
So?[A]

[.v....]
So I can't help but feel sorry[N]
for these people.[AN]
I knew the "Donateenary Tax"[N]
was a massive tax, but I had[AN]
no clue it was this bad.[N]
These people won't be able to[AN]
survive much longer under[N]
these conditions.[A]

[....v.]
I hear you, but it's not my problem.[AN]
The tax only affects our sworn enemies,[N]
the Donateenaries, I'm sure if they[AN]
renounce their faith,[N]
the tax will no longer affect them.[A]

[.v....]
Vedge...[A][X]

## Chapter1_NorthVillage
[....v.][LoadCurrent]
[.v....][LoadAwakeningAnna]
Oh hey! You're the Nameless Knights[N]
of Void, right? My sisters have[AN]
been talking about you.[N]
I had a boyfriend who went off to[AN]
join you guys but I haven't heard[N]
any word from him since.[AN]
Maybe he got lost? I'll join you[N]
guys and offer my thieving services,[AN]
hopefully I'll run into him while I[N]
travel with you guys.[A][X]

## Chapter1_SouthVillage
[....v.][LoadCurrent]
[.v....][LoadFace][0x61][0x01]
You know, many people here[N]
support the rebels.[AN]
The Queen's harsh taxes of late[N]
on imports and foodstuffs have[AN]
really made people detest[N]
Queen Void's policies.[AN]
I understand that despair, people[N]
really don't like losing the money[AN]
they worked so hard to earn,[N]
but I dunno, the Kingdom at large[AN]
has its own bills to pay too,[N]
right? Maybe Queen Void's just[AN]
having as hard times as we are,[N]
and she needs some money?[AN]
Oh I'm sorry for keeping you[N]
here, take this, it's a memento[AN]
of my father, but I'd rather[N]
see it used by brave knights[AN]
like you than gather dust on[N]
my mantle.[A][X]


## Chapter1_House
[....v.][LoadCurrent]
[.v....][LoadNotArch]
Bah. Can't your lot of knights[N]
just leave us the hell alone?![AN]
It's bad enough that we're paying[N]
most of our livelihoods on your[AN]
godsforsaken taxes, but now you're[N]
going after Jazzack too?! Right[AN]
when Jazzack had gotten his life[N]
on the straight and narrow, that[AN]
bitch of a queen raised taxes so[N]
high he couldn't keep his armory[AN]
open. He had to sell it to the[N]
government to avoid going into debt,[AN]
but any money he made from that he[N]
immediately had to give back to[AN]
the government to sate their tax[N]
rates. All because he, like many[AN]
other poor souls in this city,[N]
descend from Donateenary immigrants[AN]
that came here fleeing their own[N]
country. Those people came to our[AN]
nameless kingdom seeking freedom[N]
and new opportunities. Instead, all[AN]
they get is a life where violent[N]
rebellion seems to be their only[AN]
option...[A][2NL]
Gods, get the hell out of my house,[N]
you knights seriously piss me off.[A][X]

## Chapter1_UnusedHouse
#Shove this extra house dialogue somewhere else.
[MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML][LoadFace][0x59][0x01]
What the blazes?! Why're you here?[N]
My kidâ€™s 'avin' a nap![AN]
Can't you people take yer fightin'[N]
somewhere else?! Gods above, the[AN]
gall o' you outside folk![A][X]


## Chapter1_Objective
Put a permanent end[N]
to Jazzak's piracy.[X]

## Chapter1_Goal
Seize Throne[X]
