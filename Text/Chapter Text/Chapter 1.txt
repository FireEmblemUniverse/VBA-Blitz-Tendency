## Chapter1_Beginning
[....v.][LoadVedge]
[.v....][LoadVerge]

[....v.]
So the Donateenary rebels have[N]
based themselves here.[A]

[.v....]
Indeed. In their desperation after[N]
the fall of FEditor,[AN]
it seems these Donateenaries have[N]
become nothing more than a group of pirates.[AN]
And as pirates, they have made life[N]
a living hell for the poor,[AN]
unnamed kingdom residents living here.[A]

[....v.]
Pitiful. For what purpose should we save[N]
these people who cannot save themselves?[AN]

[.v....]
It is a knight's duty, milord.[A]

[....v.]
Fie on that, but as long as there[N]
are enemies here, I may as well[AN]
use them for training.[A][X]

## Chapter1_Ending
[....v.][LoadVedge]

[....v.]
Pitiful, if you can't pay my mother's[N]
taxes, just get another job.[AN]
Money is easy enough to come by.[A]

[.v....][LoadNull]
Vedge...[A]

[....v.]
What is it, Null?[A]

[.v....]
Are you not at all bothered by this?[AN]
These people were driven to war[N]
by your mother's oppression...[A]

[....v.]
Do you have something[N]
to say to me, Null?[A]

[.v....]
Look Vedge, I owe your family a lot.[N]
Your mother took me and my sister in,[AN]
commoners no less, after our parents[N]
were killed in the War of Blitz.[AN]
We were raised as your siblings,[N]
and I've never forgotten[AN]
my gratitude to your family.[AN]
Even so, I've also never forgotten[N]
my heritage as a commoner.[AN]
Even after my sister Nada[N]
accepted your marriage proposal,[AN]
truly making us nobility,[N]
I have not forgotten my heritage.[A]

[....v.]
So?[N]

[.v....]
So I can't help but feel sorry[N]
for these people.[AN]
I knew the "Donateenary Tax"[N]
was a massive tax, but I had[AN]
no clue it was this bad.[N]
These people won't be able to[AN]
survive much longer under[N]
these conditions[A]

[....v.]
I hear you, but it's not my problem.[AN]
The tax only affects our sworn enemies,[N]
the Donateenaries, I'm sure if they[AN]
renounce their faith,[N]
the tax will no longer affect them.[A]

[.v....]
Vedge...[A][X]

## Chapter1_NorthVillage
[....v.][LoadCurrent]
[.v....][LoadAwakeningAnna]
Oh hey![N]
You're the Nameless Knights of Void, right?[AN]
My sisters have been talking about them.[N]
I had a boyfriend who went off to[AN]
join you guys but I haven't heard[N]
any word from him since.[AN]
Maybe he got lost?[N]
I'll join you guys and offer[AN]
my thieving services, hopefully I'll[N]
run into him while I travel with you guys.[A][X]

## Chapter1_SouthVillage
[....v.][LoadCurrent]
[.v....][LoadFace][0x61][0x01]
You know, many people here support the rebels.[N]
The Queen's harsh taxes of late on imports and[AN]
foodstuffs have really made people really[N]
detest Queen Void's policies.[AN]
I understand that despair, people really don't[N]
like losing the money they worked so hard to earn,[AN]
but I dunno, the Kingdom at large has its own[N]
bills to pay too right? Maybe Queen Void's just[AN]
having as hard times as we are, and[N]
she needs some money?[AN]
Oh I'm sorry for keeping you here, take this,[N]
it's a memento of my father,[AN]
but I'd rather see it used by brave knights[N]
like you than gather dust on my mantle.[A][X]
