## Ch3Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVerge]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVedge]
Verge. Tell me, what is on[N]
the other side of this river?[A]
[MidLeft]
Milord, there's a town there.[N]
It seems like it's occupied.[AN]
Occupied by Donateenaries.[N]
There's rewards in it for you[AN]
if you bother to liberate it.[N]
That choice is up to you.[A]
[MidRight]
Rewards, huh? I like rewards.[N]
A quick detour can't hurt.[A][X]

## Ch3RecruitingBoo
[MidLeft][LoadBoo]
At last, I've figured it out![N]
The ending of the story![AN]
Soon, the world shall know[N]
how what happens after Cel-[A]
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
Are you okay? What are you on[N]
about? What's this book called?[AN]
"Seisen no Keifu"? Exotic. ...[N]
Seems like you're missing the end.[A]
[MidLeft]
Hey, be careful! I've been[N]
translating this for years![AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenMidRight]
AAAHH! Ouch... This room is just[N]
littered with your notes...[A]
[MidLeft]
Now look what you've done! The[N]
ending... It's incomprehensible![AN]
Nice job, whoever you are! Now[N]
the world will suffer for decades![AN]
[FarRight]
What's your name, anyway? I'm-[N]
[MidLeft]
I DON'T CARE, YOU BAS-[N]
[N]
[ClearFace]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x64][0x01]
Things got quite ugly.[N]
Insults were exchanged,[AN]
fists went flying, and[N]
the script was still a mess.[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadBoo]
[FarFarRight][LoadCurrent]
So will you join us? We'll cover[N]
the extra translation costs.[A]
[MidLeft]
FINE! If it will cause you to just[N]
SHUT UP ALREADY! If any enemies[AN]
get nearby, I am capable of ambushing[N]
them and getting the first blow.[A][X]

## Ch3Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVerge]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVedge]
The castle is mine. I think[N]
I'll make myself comfortable[AN]
for the night. Tomorrow, I[N]
drive the Donateenaries out.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You haven't fully liberated[N]
the town quite yet, but what[AN]
you've done is a start. There's[N]
bound to be trade in the port.[AN]
How about you call that your[N]
reward, milord?[AN]
[MidRight]
A fine idea. A little bit of[N]
plundering never went astray.[A][X]

## Ch3LowerHouse
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x58][0x01]
This town is called Script. Always[N]
been one of the weirder corners[AN]
of the Unnamed Kingdom... They say[N]
the town got its name from the many[AN]
scriptwriters and translators that[N]
made their home here. The fellow[AN]
living near the river's a right[N]
persistent type. He's been at it[AN]
for years at this point. Wouldn't[N]
be suprised if he was at it since[AN]
the days of the Blitzarre Adventure...[N]
Why do the press even call it that?[A][X]

## Ch3UpperHouse
[FarFarRight][LoadCurrent]
Seems like nobody's home.[A][X]

## Ch3UpperHouseBoo
[FarFarRight][LoadBoo]
Hello?
[MoveFarRight]Is anyone home?[A]
[FarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x0F][0x01]
Long time no see.[MoveFarLeft]You got the[N]
script, renegade translator?[A]
[FarRight]
I had it, but some bumbling idiot[N]
stomped all over the ending.[AN]
I trust you, though. Get it in[N]
there. If anyone can understand it...[A]
[FarLeft]
Don't worry, Boo. My Continue hasn't[N]
gone away... Still as fearful as ever.[AN]
I've got the tools down for a long time.[N]
I'm a renegade hacker, after all.[A]
[FarRight]
That you are. That you are. Be careful[N]
out there. Finish the job, Jay.[A][X]
