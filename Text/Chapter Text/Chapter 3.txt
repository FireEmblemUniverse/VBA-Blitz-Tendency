Verge. Tell me, what is on[N]
the other side of this river?[A]
[MidLeft]
Milord, there's a town there.[N]
It seems like it's occupied.[AN]
Occupied by Donateenaries.[N]
There's rewards in it for you[AN]
if you bother to liberate it.[N]
That choice is up to you.[A]
[MidRight]
Rewards, huh? I like rewards.[N]
A quick detour can't hurt.[A][X]

## Ch3RecruitingBoo
[MidLeft][LoadBoo]
At last, I've figured it out![N]
The ending of the story![AN]
Soon, the world shall know[N]
how what happens after Cel-[A]
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
Are you okay? What are you on[N]
about? What's this book called?[AN]
"Seisen no Keifu"? Exotic. ...[N]
Seems like you're missing the end.[A]
[MidLeft]
Hey, be careful! I've been[N]
translating this for years![AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenMidRight]
AAAHH! Ouch... This room is just[N]
littered with your notes...[A]
[MidLeft]
Now look what you've done! The[N]
ending... It's incomprehensible![AN]
Nice job, whoever you are! Now[N]
the world will suffer for decades![AN]
[FarRight]
What's your name, anyway? I'm-[N]
[MidLeft]
I DON'T CARE, YOU BAS-[N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x64][0x01]
Things got quite ugly.[N]
Insults were exchanged,[AN]
fists went flying, and[N]
the script was still a mess.[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadBoo]
[FarFarRight][LoadCurrent]
So will you join us? We'll cover[N]
the extra translation costs.[A]
[MidLeft]
FINE! If it will cause you to just[N]
SHUT UP ALREADY! If any enemies[AN]
get nearby, I am capable of ambushing[N]
them and getting the first blow.[A][X]

## Ch3Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVerge]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVedge]
The castle is mine. I think[N]
I'll make myself comfortable[AN]
for the night. Tomorrow, I[N]
drive the Donateenaries out.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You haven't fully liberated[N]
the town quite yet, but what[AN]
you've done is a start. There's[N]
bound to be trade in the port.[AN]
How about you call that your[N]
reward, milord?[AN]
[MidRight]
A fine idea. A little bit of[N]
plundering never went astray.[A][X]
