## Ch17Narration
#Ch. 16 narration/opening moved here as it already had some written by its creator.
Vedge has traveled far. Donator[N]
Island would be an idealistic[AN]
paradise where anyone could find[N]
happiness, were it not for the[AN]
giant tower covering the entire[N]
island in shadow, an impenetrable[AN]
darkness created by the tower's[N]
vigil over all of Libel...[AN]
A vigil that prevents sunlight[N]
from ever reaching the island[AN]
itself. Vedge approaches the[N]
tower, his worries mounting as[AN]
high as the shadow cast by the[N]
massive edifice...[A][X]

## Ch17Opening
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
The Tower of the Mods is more[N]
intimidating than I could've[AN]
imagined... I can't believe[N]
we're going to climb that thing,[AN]
but we must. I cannot allow my[N]
mother's evil deeds to continue.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadNull]
Lord Vedge, we've[n]
got trouble![A]
[MidRight]
What is it, Null?![A]
[MidLeft]
Unnamed Kingdom forces[n]
block the entrance to[an]
the Tower of the Mods![a]
[MidRight]
Blast![n]
Get ready, everyone![an]
Our fight to climb this[n]
tower truly begins here...[A][X]

## Ch17Village1
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x58][0x01]
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
We never thought this holy[n]
ground would become a place[an]
of war... Here, take this.[n]
May you end this conflict quickly...[A][X]

## Ch17Village2
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x59][0x01]
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
For people like you to bring[N]
your war here, it is a[AN]
disgrace! I never thought[N]
I'd see the day... Still,[AN]
as much as I detest your[N]
fighting, my red roof[AN]
dictates that I must not let[N]
you leave empty-handed, so[AN]
take this. Godspeed to you,[N]
for godspeed means that I[AN]
shall never see you again.[A][X]

## Ch17Ending
[Left][LoadNull]
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
[FarLeft][LoadVerge]
The enemy is[n]
retreating...[a]
[Left]
We've done it![n]
We've won![a]
[MidRight]
We have no time to waste![n]
We must ascend the tower now![A][X]
