## Ch22Opening
Vedge's quest for the divine[N]
Blitz of Aja continues. Hearing[N]
rumours of a legendary Blitz,[AN]
his party travels to a remote[N]
town, far away from the Unnamed[N]
Kingdom's internal turmoil.[AN]
Tales of this Blitz's power[N]
can be heard in the furthest[N]
corners of the planet.[A][X]

## Ch22Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVerge]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVedge]
So, this is where that divine[N]
Blitz is meant to be lurking.[AN]
With it, perhaps I can devour[N]
anyone fool enough to face me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Milord, you're not alone in seeking[N]
this treasure. I have word of-[A]
[MidRight]
Don't bother me about competitors![N]
There's always competitors! And the[AN]
thing about competitors... is that[N]
they just get in my way! And the[AN]
power of the void will make short[N]
work of them. Any objections?[A]
[MidLeft]
No, milord. It's just... have you heard[N]
any laughing coming from the distance?[A][X]

## Ch22Opening3
[MidLeft][LoadKefka]
Hruh-huh-huh-huh! Clinging onto hope...[N]
Like there's any hope left in this world![AN]
And for my next trick, I will make this[N]
town... disappear![A][X]

## Ch22AfterPrepScreen
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVerge]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVedge]
I feel a disturbance in the sea...[N]
It's rising far faster than it should.[A]
[MidLeft]
Milord, there are monsters spawning[N]
out of the ruins to our north.[AN]
[ClearFace][MidRight][ClearFace]
[Event]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVedge]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVerge]
First, someone needs to reach the switch[N]
inside this bar and block reinforcements.[AN]
[ClearFace][MidRight][ClearFace]
[Event]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVedge]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVerge]
After that, you need to get to this house[N]
and open the way to that... clown.[AN]
The anti-flood defences are located there,[N]
so the water around him can be removed.[A]
[MidRight]
And what happens if we take too long?[A]
[MidLeft]
Then we get washed away, along with this[N]
town and the legendary Blitz. I'd say...[AN]
we have around [Red]twelve turns[Red] to win.[N]
Otherwise, all is lost, and the realm will-[A]
[MidRight]
Plunge into darkness... The only darkness[N]
is my own darkness. With the power of the[AN]
void... I will obtain this blitz, even if[N]
it costs me my sanity. I must. I shall.[A][X]


## Ch22SabinGet
[MidLeft][LoadSabin]
THIS is the legendary Blitz? This[N]
is no Blitz! This is an axe![AN]
Blitzes are not physical objects![N]
They're powerful techniques![AN]
You can't point at something and say[N]
"This is the Suplex". That doesn't[AN]
even make sense! At least I've gotten[N]
stronger at swinging these big axes...[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
Ah, the flood defences! Time to flush[N]
Kefka out of his hiding place![A]
[MidLeft]
KEFKA?!?! What's he doing here? Probably[N]
lured in by the rumours of power...[AN]
...power he's going to take for himself![N]
And with that power, lay waste to this[AN]
entire continent! My friends have only[N]
one mission: to stop his schemes and[AN]
restore balance to this world, bound[N]
for ruin! I will fight to preserve the[AN]
world, if you'll have me along. You[N]
will? Great, time to pummel Kefka![A][X]

## Ch22ReinforcementsStopped
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][CurrentPortrait]
Well, that should take care of them.[A]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x5A][0x01]
Hey, what're you doin'? Don't[N]
push buttons randomly... That's[AN]
my job, you fool! Jobs, classes,[N]
commands... You should jump on[AN]
things, that's cool. Like a dragon[N]
plumber... Gimme another drink,[AN]
barman! Some nice cider-I mean coffee![N]
Coffee... Here, take this coffee...[AN]
It lets you take burning coffee and[N]
keep a hot hand... It's great![A][X]

## Ch22ArenaDestroyed
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKefka]
A monument to war? Hmm...[N]
I prefer a monument to nonexistence![A][X]

## Ch22TimeUp
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKefka]
Hruh-huh-huh-huh! So long, you[N]
sons of submariners! I hope you[AN]
enjoy the submarine life![A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
Damn it all! I'm going to be swept[N]
away! It's getting darker... Dark...[A][X]

## Ch22FinalPhase
[MidLeft][LoadVerge]
The water's starting to lap up on my[N]
feet! Finish this, and finish it NOW![A][X]

## Ch22Ending
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
And so, this "Legendary Blitz" was[N]
a Blitz Axe. Not a bad reward, really.[AN]
But it's not powerful enough to fight[N]
my mother. So long as she wields the[AN]
divine Super Blitz, no mortal's weapon[N]
can defeat her. One holy weapon...[AN]
...needs another holy weapon. It's[N]
as simple as that. Now, I need a boat.[A][X]


## Ch22Objective
Kill Kefka within 12[N]
turns, or else he'll...[X]
