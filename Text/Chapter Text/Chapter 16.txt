Hmm...[.....] This is a tricky[N]
cave to fly through.[AN]
I should've brought a[N]
torch along with me.[AN][......]
The enemy should be right[N]
up ahead though.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]I'm sure you've got the[N]
vision to see ahead,[.....] Takeuchi![AN]
Lead us onwards![A][X]

Wait a minute.[.....] Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Who,[....] me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm not looking at anybody else.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You could be talking to Takeuchi.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Who the heck is Takeuchi?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]That's my wyvern![.....][N]
Say hi to the man,[....] Takeuchi![A][MoveLeft]
[ToggleSmile]Woah,[.....] calm down buddy![A]
[OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes]Great.[.....][N]
Another thing that wants me dead.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Hey...[......] Pink hair...[.....] Axe by your side...[.....][N]
You ARE the man I'm looking for![A]
[OpenMidRight]
So are we gonna fight yet,[....] or...[A]
[OpenLeft]
I'm not your enemy...![.....][N]
I've been sent to help you![A]
[OpenMidRight]
By who?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Takeuchi.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Your wyvern sent you...?[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleSmile]Yep![A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleSmile][CloseEyes](Not even gonna question it...)[A][N]
[OpenEyes]Fine.[.....] Let's just get moving.[A][X]

This is the Cave of Wrath.[.....][N]
Unfortunately,[....] we have[AN]
no choice but to use[N]
it to get through.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Dammit.[.....] Why's it so dark?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
There's a group of old nomads living in this[N]
cave.[.....] They got so mad trying to find their[AN]
way through the darkness that they all[N]
developed night vision and never left.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Wow.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Either way,[....] we'll have to attack back should[N]
they choose to not let us through.[AN]
The good news is, I came prepared.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Prepared how?[.....] Did you bring torches?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Nope, I brought a map. Using the START[N]
button, we can try to get a general[AN]
understanding of where we are in the cave.[.....][N]
Though,[....] it may not help find any enemies...[A]

[OpenMidRight]
It's better than nothing.[.....][N]
Let's get moving![A][X]

[ToggleSmile]Ah,[....] good![.....][N]
You two are still here![A]

[OpenFarRight]
[ToggleSmile]I'm sorry Vedge,[....] who is this?[A]

[OpenRight]
Her name is Mariya.[.....] Said she was[N]
sent here by her wyvern.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
I was![.....] [ToggleSmile]Takeuchi,[....] my liege,[....][N]
has sent me here to help![A]

[OpenFarRight]
[ToggleSmile]Your...[......]

[OpenRight]
...liege?[A]

[OpenFarRight]
I question this woman's mental state.[AN]
She came to help us because her[N]
wyvern told her so...[AN]
This must be her feeble attempt[N]
to hide her true intentions.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
No no![.....][N]
I'm telling the truth![AN]
My words come straight from[N]
the heart of Nox![A]

[OpenFarRight]
Nox...[AN]
Can't say I've heard much[N]
of that place before.[AN]
We can't guarantee she actually[N]
speaks for that kingdom.[A]

[OpenRight]
Well,[....] we could use a wyvern rider.[AN]
And she hasn't shown any signs of[N]
possibly betraying us.[AN]
I feel like she's hiding something,[....] but I[N]
think we should keep her on our side.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
Very well.[AN]
Now,[....] let's move out of this[N]
cave before the inhabitants regroup![A][X]

The throne has been captured,[.....][N]
and the nomads have spread.[....] What now?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Have you seen a wyvern rider anywhere[N]
around the grounds?[.....] I swear there was[AN]
one with green armour flying around during[N]
the battle...[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I'm afraid not.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Unfortunate.[.....] She could have been a help.[......][N]
Besides that though,[.....] our next actions should[AN]
be to leave soon,[....] so we can plan without the[N]
fear of retaliation.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Good plan.[.....] Let's move out then![A][X]
