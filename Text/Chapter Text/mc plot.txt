Vedge upon obtaining his promotion item: I feel it… Crawling in my skin, my holy blood... It calls to me. Can I handle the weight of this power? The raw Aegir, the pure quintessence, the unmatched ether of the great Crusader God Babby. My power was already great, but were I to use this… This is to go even further beyond!! 


Prologue:
Beginning:
Vedge: We have arrived…
Verge: Yes, milord. The rebels have already formed up ranks; we’d best move forward.
Vedge: Give the order to advance. This Donateenary trash will not be allowed to continue to exist. We must seize the town they are occupying!
Verge: Yes, milord!

Village: Oh, it's the Nameless Order of Knights! We used to support the Donateenary cause, making weekly sacrifices to their god, Hex... But then, the great god Builda, manifest in his will, appeared and made our lives much easier. He, not Hex, now enjoys our eternal praise. Unfortunately, the Donateenary remnants didn't take our side-switcharooing very well and took over our humble village. We're so glad you've come to save us! Please take this as a token of our appreciation.

House Vedge starts on: 
Visitor: I've heard that the most esoteric scholars of the land, who study the mystical language of the ancients, stay together. It's almost like some sort of cul... Oh, never mind me. I mustn't spread rumors. Besides, it doesn't sound like the worst idea! I wouldn't mind being welcome in dwellings across the land here and there based on knowledge alone...

Vergein boss quote: Hmph. Nameless Knights. Prepare to face death.

Vergein: I lost… lost my… Ugh...


Ending: 
Vedge: How pathetic. How did such a pitiful organization ever revive the Demon King twenty years ago?
Verge: By all accounts, milord, the Donateenaries were much more relevant in the past. Their present weakness is a welcome opportunity to destroy them once and for all...
Vedge: How would you know? You didn't fight in the war. You ran, you coward! You let my grandparents die!
Verge: And I have spent the last twenty years trying to atone for my cowardice, and in my efforts to atone I-
Vedge: Shut up, Verge. There's another rebel base ahead we need to capture.

Chapter 1:
Opening: In a time long past, the gods themselves walked these lands. Our continent of Libel  was home to several, the Crusader Gods. These gods taught man the powers of making and unmaking, but with their power came a destructive being. This being, originally known as Ztilb, took many forms and brought great destruction upon our continent. However, his body was always destroyed by a hero carrying a weapon blessed by one of the Crusader Gods, bringing about a brief era of peace known as the “New Day”. Vedge is the son of Void, the hero queen who brought about the New Day Libel during which Vedge currently lives. Little does Vedge know, this era of peace is soon to end...
 
Beginning
Vedge: So, the Donateenary rebels have based themselves here?
Verge: Indeed. In their desperation after the fall of FEditor, it seems these Donateenaries have become nothing more than a group of  pirates. As pirates, they have made life a living hell  for the poor Unnamedite residents living here.
Vedge: Pathetic. For what purpose should we save these people who cannot save themselves?
Verge: It is a knight's duty, milord.
Vedge: Fie to that! … But as long as there are enemies here, I may as well use them for training.

Northern Village:
Anna: Oh, hey! You're the Nameless Knights of Void, right? My sisters have been talking about them. I had a boyfriend who went off to join your ranks, but I haven't gotten any word from him since. Maybe he got lost? Oh, I know! I'll join you guys and offer my thieving services! Knowing my luck, I'll run into him while we travel together.

Southern Village:
Young Woman: You know, many people here support the rebels. The Queen's harsh taxes on imports and foodstuffs have really made people really detest her policies. I understand that despair; people really don't like losing the money they worked so hard to earn, but... I dunno, the Kingdom at large has its own bills to pay too, right? Maybe Queen Void's just having as hard a time as we are and she needs some money?... I went off on a ramble there, didn’t I? Sorry about that. Take this: it's a memento of my father, but I'd rather see it used by brave warriors like you than gather dust on my mantle.


Eastern Yellow House: 
Homeowner: What the blazes?! Why’re you here? My kid’s ‘avin’ a nap! Can't you people take yer fightin’ somewhere else?! Gods above, the gall o’ you outside folk!

House:
Angry Villager ~~with a face suspiciously like Arch's~~ (suggestion: NotArch in plainclothes): Bah. Can't your band of knights just leave us the hell alone? It's bad enough that we're paying most of our livelihoods on your gods-forsaken taxes, but now you're going after Jazzack too?! Right when Jazzack had gotten his life on the straight and narrow, that bi-- dastard of a queen raised taxes so high he couldn't keep his armory open. He had to sell it to the government to avoid going into debt, but any money he made from that he immediately had to give back to the government to pay more taxes! Did YOU have any idea there was a special tax on property rights to armories?! I sure didn’t! All because he, like many other poor souls in this city, descend from Donateenary immigrants that came here fleeing their war-torn country. All these people wanted was someplace where they could live their lives in peace! Instead, all they get is a life where violent rebellion is their only option… Gods. Get the hell out of my house. Next time I see one of you knights around here, I’ll be sending some strongly-worded letters...

Jazzack Boss Quote: Your queen has destroyed our way of life. It’s time for me to take matters into my own hands!

Jazzack Death Quote: In truth, death could be seen as a freedom of its own...

Chapter End:
Vedge: Pitiful... If you can't pay my mother's taxes, just get another job! Money is easy enough to come by.
Null: Vedge…
Vedge: What is it, Null?
Null: Are you not at all bothered by this? These people were driven to war by your mother's actions…
Vedge: Do you have something to say to me, Null?
Null: Look, Vedge, I owe your family a lot. Your mother took in my sister and myself after our parents were killed in the War of Blitz, commoners though we may have been. We were raised as your siblings, and I shall never forget my gratitude to your house... Even so, I've also never forgotten my heritage as a commoner. Even after my sister Nada accepted your marriage proposal, truly making me nobility, I have not forgotten.
Vedge: So?
Null: So I can't help but feel sorry for these people. I knew the “Donateenary Tax” was a massive tax, but I had no clue it was this bad. These people won't be able to survive much longer under these conditions.
Vedge: I hear you, but it's not my problem. The tax only affects our sworn enemies, the Donateenaries. I'm sure things will get better for them when they’re finally willing to swear fealty to my mother.
Null: Vedge…

Chapter 2:
Opening: Following the defeat of the Donateenary rebels, Vedge returns to the Nameless Capital of the Nameless Kingdom. Null's words sit in his mind, constantly nagging at him. He is bothered; not by the words themselves, but by the fact he cannot get them out of his mind...

Beginning:
Vedge: Mother, I have returned.
Void: Ah, Vedge. How fared the campaign against the donateenary rebellion? 
Vedge: It went well, mother, but... I saw something that’s been eating at the back of my mind since the battle.
Null: …
Void: Oh? Speak, boy, lest I believe you to be-
Generic Soldier: Attack! The Donateenary rebels are attacking! They've seized some of the thrones!
Void: What?! How could this be?! Vedge, secure the northern entrance to the castle while I protect the south. My Super Blitz Lance is more than enough to handle those rats.
Vedge: Yes, Mother. At least I'll get a decent workout, I suppose...

 
Chapter Won:
Void: Vedge, it seems the Donateenaries were behind this attack too. Your father Leeroy has traced them to a castle in the south. I want you to take your forces and deal with them now.
Vedge: Of course, Mother, but first-
Void: Insolent whelp! Did you hear my order or not?! There’s no time for your frivolous questions. Now GET MOVING!

Chapter 4:
Opening: Following Vedge's successful pacification of the town of Script’s periphery, he heads deeper into the city in hopes of ending the rebels who attacked his home. A great battle awaits him there...

Beginning:
Vedge: The enemy has already taken position?
Verge: Yes. milord. It would seem this part of the town is the last stronghold of the Donateenary clan in this city. Once we defeat them, our pacification of Script will be complete.
Vedge: Good! Then let's free this town.

Leftmost Village: 
Old Woman: I can't believe this war is happening. As poor a ruler Queen Void has been, I never would have contemplated rebellion. Oh, if only the good King Abyss were here... He was such a fine king. I was given this by him before his demise at the hands of the Donateenaries. Take it; having something signaling I support the royal family is dangerous these days...

Right Village:
Visitor: Hm? Who left this thing here? I suppose no one would mind if I were to take it...

Ending Event:
Vedge:.....
Null: Vedge, are you alright?
Vedge: I'm fine, Null. I just… didn't realize the discontent with my mother was so widespread.
Those men, they fought with honor despite being rebels, and they must have had good reason to do so...
Verge: Sire, worry not about the personal lives of our enemy. They would not show you the same courtesy. Besides, we must move out posthaste: your mother has requested our presence in the region of Dark Sanctity.
Vedge: Dark Sanctity? Mother and I used to go there for vacation when I was a child… Let’s go.

Chapter 5:
Opening:
The River known as Dark Sanctity was known for many horrific battles once waged there. It is said all wars in the history of Libel, in some manner or another, started on the banks of this river. Despite this, the river's majestic sheen and historical relevance made it a popular vacation destination among the people of the Nameless Kingdom, and in peaceful times, there is no more pleasant place on the globe. Unfortunately, the river’s sinister propensity to spark conflicts was about to rear its ugly head once again...

Beginning:
 Void: You have done well, my son. I am proud of you.
Vedge: Mother, this has been bothering me too much. These rebels have rebelled because of your taxation on the Donateenary people! They decided to fight despite knowing there was no way they could win... Please, tell me, what role does justice play in these stringent policies?! With taxes so high, they cannot afford to live!
Void: You're right; they can't. That's kind of the point.
Null: What?!
Void: The Donateenaries are a horrible people who seek the revival of a wicked god. This ambition of theirs led Libel to a horrific war twenty years ago that started on this very soil... The war that killed your grandparents. Such a people should not be allowed to exist.
Vedge: Unless they willingly do whatever you say.
Void: What?!
Vedge: Null and Nada are commoners who descend from the Donateenaries! You told me as much yourself five years ago!
Null: I told you- what?!
Vedge: If such a people are truly innately corrupt, why would you allow me to marry one into our household?
Void: I shall fix that mistake very shortly. If you descend from the Donateenaries, you must die. You just had to figure it all out, didn’t you, Vedge?
Vedge: In that case, I will lead the rebellion against you! Stealing the lives of so many without giving them a chance to atone is something I cannot allow!
Void: You would defy me directly?! The punishment for treason is death!! All units, teach this boy some manners! Leave not a man alive! I must return to the castle for now.
Vedge: Bring it on, Mom! Just try and stop my fight for this righteous cause. When I’m finished, this will be a land where genocide is not tolerated!

Village:
Villager: Prince Vedge has stood up in rebellion?! This is such great news! Maybe now our people have hope for a slightly less tyrannical ruler… Take this; consider it a sign of my support for your cause.

Chapter Won
Vedge: I… can't believe I just did that.
Verge: Sire, we must get moving.
Vedge: Verge, everyone, why did you continue to support me?! You should’ve stopped me! I...
Null: We can discuss that later! For the moment, we must fly!
Vedge: Nowhere in the Nameless Kingdom will be safe… Where should we go?
Verge: My parents were born in the kingdom of Kagavesta. They live there even today, as advisors to the land’s king. Perhaps we can seek counsel from them.
Vedge: To Kagavesta, then!

Chapter 6:
Opening: Shaking off pursuits from his mother, Vedge heads west, to Kagavesta and his destiny. The Kingdom of Kagavesta is a small country, said to worship the first of the Crusader Gods and father of all things, Kaga. Known for its devoutness, the kingdom’s people sacrificed most other things on the altar of its faith. Could such a place truly provide Vedge aid?

Beginning:
Vedge: So this is Kagavesta?
Verge: Yes, milord, but it would appear we have uninvited guests.
Vedge: Bandits, huh? Whatever. Let's take care of them; should get us into good graces with the locals.

Visitable house 1:
Visitor: Hmm… there's no one here. I guess they wouldn't mind if I took this…

Visitable House 2: 
Villager: The falcon is such a majestic animal, don't you think? Ah... If I were cursed to turn into an animal, I'd be a falcon. I mean, if I could choose which animal I became. With no choice, I'd probably end up as some sort of lazy snake.

V. House 3:
Villager: There’s a popular saying here in Kagavesta: “Only a lowlife with experience can convince a lowlife of experience.” If you heed its wisdom… Well, to be perfectly honest, I just made that up, and even I’m not sure what I’m getting at here, so it’s gotta be good, right?

Chapter Won:
Vedge: That deals with the bandits, but where are Kagavesta's knights? Shouldn't they be here?
Verge: Indeed, and our foes here fought not like bandits, but almost like a foreign legion..
Vedge: Let's head to the castle. I have a bad feeling about this…

Chapter 7:
Opening: 
Edgelard: Sensei, I told you so. The chests were to blame. We must never allow these chests to be opened.
Enemy Soldier: Milady, enemy reinforcements!
Edgelard: What?! Everyone, do not allow the chests to be opened! They will bring our ruin!

If all chests opened:
Edgelard: NO! Sensei, I have failed you! EVERYONE, KILL THE MONSTERS! NO SURVIVORS! DEATH TO THEM ALL!!!

Boss Quote If Chests not opened: This castle is my Sensei's. I will not allow you to bar my path.

Boss Quote if Chests opened: YOU! YOOOOOU! DIE DIE DIE DIE!!!!!

Chapter Won:
Vedge: I recognized their leader…
Null: Oh?
Vedge:  She was in Edgelord school with me when we were kids. She was the heir to the Dominion of General. I understand now... The soldiers invading Kagavesta are knights of General!
Null: I wonder what their purpose here is?
 Vedge: Hmm…
*Noises*
Vedge: There's still fighting going on?! Let's go find the source of that noise!
Null: Yes, milord!



Ch8 (Alusq): intro:

Opening: Vedge had prepared to venture deeper into the castle in search of the noise he heard, but as he followed the noise it led down a long hallway which abruptly terminated in the middle of a vast marshland. The rest of the castle nowhere to be seen through a lattice of stone pillars erected throughout, Vedge forges into the marsh as he glimpses Generalese soldiers in the distance...

(Already done in beginning of chapter: Vedge finds Ersatz and Fanni, who are locked in battle against Dennis, a general put in charge of exterminating rebellious manakete tribes. Ersatz promises that he and Fanni will help Vedge if Vedge helps him reclaim his home from Dennis.
Already done in end of chapter: Vedge, having defeated Dennis, demands surrender. Dennis attempts to give Vedge money; if Ersatz is not alive, you get 5000 gold. Otherwise, Ersatz kills Dennis before he can give the money.)

Additional ch end text:
Vedge: That was a bizarre ordeal… What were the Kagavestans hoping to accomplish here? Who was that man? He didn’t seem related to the Generalites…
Null: My parents once told me a story of an ancient empire whose generals subjugated tribes of dragonfolk to use as weapons of war… Those who resisted were killed.
Vedge: Interesting. That old man did mention an “empire” earlier, didn’t he?
Null: Indeed, but the empire collapsed a millennium ago. Its emperor, tiring of his lavish life, decided to give all of his money to members of nobility across the continent, who promptly used their newfound wealth to fund a mass invasion of the empire’s lands. While I know not how one of those generals could possibly exist today, perhaps this man was some sort of fanatic inspired by the tales of old…
Vedge: No more time for stories, Null! Look: there are Generalese banners flying over the castle! We’ve got to go back in!
Null: Gods above! I hadn’t even been able to see the castle through the mist before… Perhaps that was their true motive! They-
Vedge: Didn’t I tell you there’s no time, Null?! Come on!

Chapter 9:
Opening: After a detour into a marshland beset by anachronism, Vedge heads into the core of Kagavesta Castle. The castle is quite large, giving the invading Dominion of General ample time to hide despite Vedge's impromptu assault. Despite this, here at the core of the castle, this battle will end, and with its end Vedge will discover his destiny...

Beginning: 
Vedge: We've made it this far. Who would've thought this castle would be so overrun with Generalese troops?
Verge: Their King led this invasion and likely commands the soldiers from within. Edgelard's Sensei, her father.
Vedge: A man who would condemn his daughter to death in war to conquer Kagavesta... A man much like my own mother. Such people cannot be allowed to exist!
Null: Then let us punish him together, milord.
Verge: Be careful, milord! I hear the King of General's elite guard consists of terrors he personally tamed.
Vedge: In that case, watch out for monsters, everyone!

Boss Quote: This castle is mine. Come no closer unless you wish for death!

Boss Death Quote: They… always said there would be a light… Was I unable to earn it…?

Chapter End:
Vedge: So ends the royal family of the Dominion of General.
????: So you've come…
Vedge: AAAAAAAAAAHH! Who are you?!?!
????: I'm a ghost, as you can see, and ghosts have no need for names. However, I do believe I can be of help to you. You seek a means to cut short your mother's genocide, do you not?
Vedge: Even if I do, why should I trust someone who will not tell me their name?
????: My name is meaningless, although I suppose you do need to call me something...
????: Very well, call me Jane.
Vedge: Miss Jane.
Jane: Just Jane is fine. Anyway, you seek a means to stop your mother?
Vedge: Indeed. Regardless of what crimes the Donateenaries have committed in the past, genocide is a much worse crime to visit upon them in return.
Jane: I see the resolve in your eyes, but resolve alone will not allow you to best your mother as long as she wields the Super Blitz Lance. You need an edge, a means to challenge her on equal footing, and the only place where you can get that is the Tower of the Mods.
Vedge: The great tower overlooking all of Libel…
Jane: The very same. At the top of the tower lies a means to unlock your true strength: the Void Medallion. 
Vedge: If I obtain this medallion, will I earn the strength to defeat Mother?
Jane: Indeed. Great power lies in that medallion, and only those of your bloodline, blessed by the Crusader God Babby, only you and your mother can use it.
Vedge: So it is a race then.
Jane: Indeed. However, there is hope. Your mother knows of the medallion, but not its location.
Vedge: I have a head start, then. I must make haste to the Tower of the Mods!

Jane:... May the Crusader Gods bless your journey, chosen hero. May you finally bring peace to this land…

Chapter 10:
Opening: The Tower of the Mods. Resting on an island separate from the mainland, this tower overlooks all of Libel. It is said the Crusader Gods live in this place, watching over the many countries of the vast continent. Vedge, in an effort to defeat his mother, must now journey to this tower and obtain one of the fabled treasures said to be hidden within, the Void Medallion. On his way there he passes a town named Lakeside, occupied by Unnamed Kingdom forces instead of the Kagavestan troops that should have resided there…

Beginning:
Verge: Trouble is abrew, milord. Unnamed Kingdom forces are mobilizing!
Vedge: What? But this is a Kagavestan city. What are my mother's troops doing here?
Verge: They must have invaded during the confusion at the castle.
Vedge: Then we'll seize this whole city! Everyone, let's march!
Verge: I have a bad feeling about this, milord. The tides in this region are known to be volatile.
Vedge: Then let’s capture the city before it’s too late!

Chapter Won:
Vedge: How could Kagavesta be so crippled after a single defeat? Where are its people? Come to think of it, the royal family were absent from the castle… Why aren't they doing something? It's almost like the majority of the nation has vanished... But why?

Chapter 11:
 Opening:
Kagavesta's cities are occupied by the forces of the Unnamed Kingdom, complete with a blockade of Kagavesta's ports. Vedge quickly realizes that his mother knows the secret in the Tower of the Mods. Without a personal ship to break the blockade, Vedge scrambles to find another way to reach Donator Island, where the Tower of the Mods resides….  
Beginning:
Vedge: Verge, what do you think of my plan?
Verge: Pardon my bluntness, milord, but I think this is crazy. Assaulting the Fort of Fight is a ludicrous idea!
Vedge: Under any other circumstances, I'd agree. Unfortunately, however, the underground passage in that fort is our only means of accessing Donator Island without obtaining a ship and running the blockade, and to be frank, we have better odds taking this fortress than we do defeating the Unnamed navy with a single ship.
Verge: I… Very well, milord. While our plan is not ironclad, it is preferable to fending off a hundred ironclad frigates. I will give the order to attack.


Luut recruitment:
Luut: Hold! Are you Lord Vedge of the Unnamed Kingdom?
Vedge: I am.
Luut: Please, you must help me save my sister!
Vedge: Who are you?
Luut: My name is Luut. My sister, Doot, fights for your mother. I have been looking for her, only to be led away from her for too long and witness her brainwashing at the hands of your mother... Please, you must allow me to join you so I can put her out of her misery.
Vedge: Fine by me. The more, the merrier!
Luut: One more thing...
Vedge: ?
Luut: If you see Doot, kill her. Do not hesitate.
Vedge: Kill… your sister?
Luut: In the state she is currently in, if you don’t, you are already dead.


Chapter Won:
Vedge: Now that we've secured this smaller fort, we can move on to the Fort of Fight proper. Let's go!  
Chapter 12 (Zaim/Zmr)
Opening:
Verge: It appears we've reached the famous Fort of Fight.
Vedge: Ah, I believe this is where we can fight to hone our skills.
Verge: It'll be useful practice for when we fight our enemies. However, the inhabitants of this fort don't go easy on anyone who challenge it. It's life or death.
[Cameron appears]
Cameron: Hey, I'm Cameron. I own this fort. Wanna fight?
Vedge: Sure.
Cameron: Cool. Let's fight in the Fort of Fight, then.
Verge: I mean, what else would we be here for?
Cameron: We do have karaoke nights here as well.
Vedge: I have no interest in such idle activities while a war is being waged. The sooner we get to the battle, the better.
[Bojo appears, dark text bubble]
Bojo: ...350 million… It's not too late… To save… Bre-
Vedge: Uh, what's the manchild on about?
Cameron: Oh just ignore him. He's like our version of Hulk from Ragnarok. Bojo is the strongest fighter in this fort, being well versed in the darkest arts. Unfortunately he's a bit behind mentally but don't underestimate him!
Vedge: Very well, let's get to the fight then.
Jet: Hold up! Don't forget me!
Vedge: Just who might you be?
Jet: I'm Jet, a travelling bard. I'm not sure how I got here but I feel hearing my inspiring tune will keep your knights refreshed while you fight in this fort. My musical talent is excellent if I say so myself.
Vedge: I don't particularly care for your music myself but if it helps us kill things faster then feel free to contribute your talent to us.
Jet: Wonderful. Now let's get this crazy party started!

Chapter 13:
Beginning:
Vedge: I've always hated this cave.
Null: I care nothing for it as well, my lord. This heat is appalling.
Verge: Milord, Unnamed Kingdom forces approach!
Vedge: Well, time to see how much heat we can take!

Mealy Recruitment:
Mealy: Excuse me, sir. What is one such as yourself doing in such an unholy place?
Vedge: I could ask you the same question.
Mealy: Fair enough! My tale is a fairly simple one: a thief stole everything I own and left me here. What is your tale?
Vedge: I’m on my way to the Tower of the Mods. While I can’t pay you at present, if you help me, I’ll pay you big bucks when the war is over.
Mealy: Deal.

Chapter Won:
Vedge: Whew, I should work out in heat like this more often. Hard to care about the intolerable heat when you're too busy fighting.
Verge: Milord, the exit is just ahead.
Vedge: Let's go. The Tower of the Mods awaits!


Chapter 14 (Tequila)

Beginning:
[Vedge and Verge arrive from the top of the map]
Verge: We've arrived, milord.
Vedge: Yes, I'd noticed. Do you remember the plan?
Verge: I do.
Vedge: Then tell it to me.
Verge: You politely ask for directions while I loom menacingly behind you.
Vedge: And if there's any trouble?
Verge: I shriek like a little girl and run away, leaving you to the tender mercies of said trouble.
Vedge: Very good. Let's go.
[Move towards house; Splenda appears]
Splenda: Why, hello there, dearies! I wasn't expecting visitors today.
Vedge: Good day, madam. We're traveling to the Tower of the Mods, but got a bit sidetracked. We were hoping you'd be able to tell us how best to reach it.
Splenda: But of course, my little sugar lumps! In fact, I'll do one better and show you myself. The landscape can be quite difficult to navigate if you're not a witch.
Vedge: Oh, that's very kind of you, ma'am. We'd be much obliged-- hang on, did you say witch?
S: Yes, dearie. I'm--
Verge: Eek!
[Verge runs away]
Splenda: Er...is your friend alright?
Vedge: Probably. I think he was just scared of you.
Splenda: Oh, no need for that! I'm a good witch! Splenda's the name; Splenda the Sweet. I wouldn't have done anything bad to him!
Vedge: Nice to meet you, Splenda. I'm Vedge. So… a good witch, huh?
Splenda: That's right, pumpkin. Licensed and everything!
Vedge: You… have a witch license?
Splenda: Yep! The guild requires all good witches to be licensed and registered. Wicked witches are supposed to be card carriers as well, but, y'know, they're wicked, so they don't play by the rules.
Vedge: So... you could, say, be a wicked witch pretending to be a good witch?
Splenda: … You know, sweetie, I've never thought of it that way. I suppose that would be possible, but I assure you, I am a good witch.
Vedge: I believe you.
Splenda: Excellent! That means we can get going right away!
Vedge: Right now? Don't you need to, uh, get ready, or pack, or something?
Splenda: I've already packed, as a matter of fact.
Vedge: That's awfully convenient.
Splenda: Isn't it? I was actually planning on making the journey to the Tower of the Mods myself; I'm running low on certain ingredients.
Vedge: ...
Splenda: Oh, don't worry, darling. Not eye of newt or fenny snake or any of that nonsense. We good witches aren't allowed to use such abominable ingredients; it's against guild rules.
Vedge: … I see. Well, actually, I don't see, but I'll take your word for it. If you're ready to go, we'll follow.
Splenda: Excellent, pumpkin. I won't fly too high or fast so you can keep up.
Vedge: ...Fly?
[Splenda leaves]
Vedge: Of course. She's a witch. Of course she's going to fly. How lovely.
[Camera pans south; enter Wicky]
Wicky: SPLENDA!
[Camera pans north]
Splenda: Oh, dear.
Vedge: Uh, Splenda? Who is that?
Splenda: That, my precious, is Wicky.
Vedge: Wicky?
Splenda: Well, she goes by WWOANSCD--
Vedge: Gesundheit!
Splenda: --but that sounds like a sneeze, so everyone calls her Wicky instead. Also, thank you.
Vedge: Is that noise supposed to mean something?
Splenda: It stands for "Wicked Witch Of A Non-Specific Cardinal Direction". Poor thing was set on being a wicked witch, but all the good names were already taken.
Vedge: Wicked witch?
Splenda: Oh, yes, sugar lump. Extremely wicked. She's here to kill me. That's one of the reasons I was already packed.
Vedge: I see. I don't suppose it's not too late to, uh, not be here? Hide? Run away? Teleport?
Splenda: No, dearie. I never was much good in teleporting class. I couldn't even warp myself, much less all of you. I'm afraid we're going to have to face her, and almost certainly die horribly in the attempt.
Vedge: But... but... I'm on a mission! I can't die now! We must fight!
Splenda: Oh, honey. I admire your bravery, but she's way too strong for any of us.
[Camera pans to Wicky]
Wicky: That's right, little Splenda! You and your band of misfits can't hope to defeat me! In fact, I'm so powerful, I think I'll just let my familiars slaughter you!
[Wicky summons enemies]
[Camera pans north]
Splenda: Oh my…
Vedge: Did she make those things?
Splenda: Yes… I hadn't realized she was so strong. This is serious dark magic.
Vedge: Well, let's kill those things instead. Maybe that'll make her go away.
Splenda: I doubt it, cupcake. Although… perhaps…
Vedge: Hmm?
Splenda: It must take an awful lot of energy, summoning that many creatures at once. Perhaps, if she keeps raising them, she will grow weaker. I suggest not going near her too quickly, however.
Vedge: Right.

End:
Vedge: Ding dong, the witch is dead!
Splenda: Alas, poor Wicky. I knew her, Vedge; a woman of infinite cruelty, and, uh, not much else.
Vedge: ‘Alas'? Sounds more like ‘Good riddance!' to me!
Splenda: Yes, well, a good witch shouldn't revel in the loss of human life, even an irredeemable pile of garbage like herself. It's in the code of conduct.
Vedge: Er… right…
Splenda: Anyway, enough mourning! Are you ready to continue onwards?
Vedge: Yes. Let's go!

Chapter 15 (Tequila)
[Enter Vedge, Verge, and Splenda from the top]
Vedge: What is this place?
Splenda: These are the ruins of Aquilet. We have to pass through them on our way to the Tower of the Mods. Pretty, aren't they?
Verge: Not really. They're... ruined.
Vedge: Pah! You have no appreciation for fine architecture, Verge.
Verge: As you say, milord.
Vedge: Why, just look at the clean lines, the proportionality, the… Actually, I can't say this with a straight face. Verge is right. It looks awful.
Verge: Thank you for your revised opinion of my architectural critiques, milord.
Vedge: You're quite-- hang on, what's that?
[Enter Zane]
Verge: Eek!
[Verge runs away]
Vedge: Um…
Zane: Splenda? Is that you?
Splenda: Um…
Vedge: Friend of yours?
Splenda: I... don't think so?
Zane: Splenda! It's me, Zane! You nursed me back to health last year after I was set upon by a pack of gargoyles.
Splenda: Oh, my. Yes, I do remember you! But what happened? You look a tad... malnourished.
Zane: I fell afoul of a curse in these very ruins, locking my soul into my body even as it disintegrated around me.
Splenda: Oh no! Is there anything I can for you?
Zane: Well…
[Enter Benny]
Zane: What the--?
Benny: Woof!
Zane: Ow! Get off of me!
[Benny runs off]
Zane: OI! GET BACK HERE!
Vedge: Er... did a dog monster just run off with your foot?
Zane: Yes! Along with my tibia and my middle phalanges!
Splenda: Oh, no! Does it hurt?
Zane: Not... really? Kind of? I don't really know how to describe it. It tingles.
Vedge: My solemn condolences.
Splenda: Oh, but we must help Zane, Vedge!
Vedge: We... do? I mean, we're kind of in a hurry to get to the Tower of the Mods… Besides, what exactly do you expect us to--
[Exit Splenda]
Vedge: --Dammit, she’s gone.
[Enter monsters]
Vedge: Oh, come ON! Do we have to fight everything from here to the ends of the earth before we can finally get to the Tower?
Zane: Probably.
Vedge: You... are these creatures your doing?
Zane: No. The ruins are... unquiet. I do not know why.
Vedge: Oh, I know why. It’s because the universe wants me to get enough exercise.
Zane: Really?
Vedge: No. Now stay put while we get your bones back. Uh, not that you have much choice, I guess.
Zane: Right. Thanks.

[When starting the chapter]
Vedge: Splenda! What are you doing?
Splenda: We have to find that dog!
Vedge: And what do you propose we do when we find it? Cuddle it?
Splenda: I’ll talk to it.
Vedge: You’ll...talk to it? You can talk to demon hounds?
Splenda: Yes! Well, probably. Maybe. I haven’t tried before.
Vedge: …
Splenda: Come on! It’ll be fun!
[Splenda leaves]
Vedge: Fun. Yes. That is exactly the word I was looking for.

[Getting close to Benny, first and second times, if not Splenda]
Benny: Yip! Yap! Woof woof!
Active character: Alright, nice doggy...just drop the bones…
Benny: Yip!
[Benny buries the bone and runs off]
Active character: I think it just buried something. I should investigate.

[Getting close to Benny, first and second times, if Splenda]
Benny: Yip! Yap! Woof woof!
Splenda: Hey! That’s not a very nice thing to say!
Benny: Yip!
[Benny buries the bone and runs off]
Splenda: Aww, he ran off. Guess I should see what he just buried.

[Find a bone]
Active character: This looks like one of the bones we’re looking for. I should bring this back to Zane. 
[Cutscene with Zane and Active Character]
Active character: I’ve recovered one of your bones.
[If first bone]
Zane: Hey, my tibia! Thanks a lot!
Active character: If you don’t mind me asking, how exactly are you going to reattach it?
Zane: Skeleton magic, of course!
Active character: I see.
[Active character leaves]
Zane: By which I mean, duct tape.
[If second bone]
Zane: Hey, my foot! Thanks a lot!
Active character: Uh... you’re welcome.
[Active character leaves]
Zane: At least I can walk again...

[Getting close to Benny, third time, if not Splenda]
Benny: Yip! Grrr…
Active character: Nice doggy... just drop the bones…
Benny: GRRRRR!
Active character: On second thought, I’m not sure my health insurance covers demon rabies. I’d better let Splenda handle this.

[Getting close to Benny, third time, if Splenda]
Benny: Yip! Grrr…
Splenda: You just stay put, there’s a good boy.
Benny: GRRRRR!
Splenda: Hush, you.

[Splenda talks to Benny (NOTE: This ends the chapter)]
Splenda: Alright, young pup. You have something I want.
Benny: Woof?
Splenda: Benny is your name? That’s nice, but don’t change the subject. You know exactly what I’m talking about.
Benny: Woof.
Splenda: That’s right. Hand it over.
Benny: Yip! Grrr…
Splenda: Don’t make me force you.
Benny: Whimper…
[Choice: Force Benny to drop the bone?]
[If yes]
Benny: Yip!
Splenda: I warned you!
Benny: GRRRRRR!
[Benny runs off]
Splenda: Shame, that. He was kind of cute.
Tutorial text box: Author’s note: I guess it’s true. There really is no accounting for taste.
[Splenda walks over to Zane]
Splenda: I believe this is yours.
Zane: My favorite finger! You’ve returned it! Thank you so much, Splenda.
Splenda: The pleasure is all mine, believe me.
[Enter Vedge]
Vedge: Was it really?
Splenda: Well...it wasn’t exactly my favorite moment, no…
Vedge: Yeah, mine neither. Anyway, do you have all your bones now, Zane?
Zane: I do, thanks to you and your friends.
Vedge: Excellent. Can we PLEASE leave now? These ruins and their fine architecture are seriously getting me down.
Splenda: I don’t see why not.
Zane: I don’t suppose…
Vedge: Yes?
Zane: Could I come with you?
Verge: And do what, exactly?
Zane: Well, I used to be pretty handy with a blade back when I was alive. I could, uh, fight things for you. I just feel obliged to Splenda, you see…
Vedge: Why not. Just stay away from any dogs you might see.
Zane: Will do, sir.
Vedge: Call me Vedge.
Zane: Alright...Vedge.
Splenda: Onwards, to the tower!

[If no]
Splenda: Man...I just can’t say no to that face. Alright, you can hang on to the bone for now, but don’t--
Benny: *crunch*
Splenda: --eat it.
Benny: …
Splenda: …
Benny: Arf?
Splenda: No, that was not something a good boy would do.
Benny: Woof.
Splenda: Of course it was important! There’s probably thousands of bones lying around; why did you have to steal three that were still attached?!
Benny: Yip. Arf arf woof.
Splenda: I don’t care if they taste better! You’re coming back with me to that nice skeleton and apologizing right now!
Benny: Whine…
[Cut to Splenda and Benny meeting up with Zane]
Splenda: Zane, I’m sorry, but Benny here ate your finger.
Zane: …
Benny: Arf.
Splenda: He says he’s sorry too.
Zane: You mean to tell me you can actually talk to this thing?
Benny: Woof!
Splenda: He says he’s not a thing, he’s a complex creature with thoughts and feelings.
Zane: Well, excuuuuuse me, Princess!
Benny: Arf arf yap!
Splenda: You know, I’d say he’s quite justified being angry, considering you ate his finger.
Benny: Woof…
[Benny moves over to Zane, presumably to lick him]
Zane: Ok, ok! [Benny moves back] That’s...well, not alright, but I guess I’ll make do. You did manage to retrieve the rest of my leg, so I can at least walk around.
Splenda: You’re going to stay here?
Zane: Yeah. I’ll probably find something to replace my finger. Maybe I can graft a chainsaw or something instead…
Splenda: A chainsaw? What’s that?
Zane: ...I’ve said too much. You’d better go, before the creatures come back.
Splenda: Aww...well, it was nice seeing you again.
[Splenda leaves]
Benny: Yip!
[Benny leaves]
[new conversation]
Splenda: Vedge! We can keep going now.
[Enter Vedge]
Vedge: Thank goodness.
[Enter Benny]
Benny: Arf! Arf! Woof woof!
Splenda: What? You want to come with us?
Benny: Yip!
Vedge: Whoa whoa whoa. Hold on just a second. Why are we taking a demon dog with us again?
Splenda: I think he likes me.
Benny: Yap!
Vedge: ...I can’t believe I’m seriously considering this. What’s he going to eat?!
Splenda: What does the rest of your army eat?
Vedge: I...y’know, I never asked. I just assumed they photosynthesize like me. Well, if you can vouch for his behavior, I guess he can come along. Just make sure he stays away from Verge. I think he’s allergic.
Splenda: Oh, thank you, Lord Vedge! Come on, boy! We’re going on an adventure!
Benny: Yip! Yap! Awoooooo!

[If Benny is killed]
Splenda: Nooo! Animal cruelty!
Vedge: Animal cruelty? Are you out of your mind, woman?
Splenda: …
Vedge: Um...I’m sorry for yelling at you...please don’t turn me into a newt.
Splenda: …It’s alright. But I’m afraid it seems Zane’s bones have been crushed when the hound was slain.
Vedge: Oh.
Splenda: I feel...I have to help Zane.
Vedge: Uh...why?
Splenda: I was taught to help those in need.
Vedge: Well, technically, we’re in need too.
Splenda: This is true. I can give you directions to the Tower; the best path is not far from here. However, I shall remain here.
Vedge: I see. Well, I don’t see, but I shall respect your wishes. Thank you for your help so far.
Splenda: Of course. Now, you’ll want to…
[Tutorial text box]: Vedge receives directions to the Tower of the Mods and promptly forgets them. Fortunately, Splenda is willing to write them down. They bid each other farewell and safe travels.

Chapter 16:
Opening: 
Vedge has traveled far. Donator Island would be an idealistic paradise where anyone could find happiness, were it not for the giant tower covering the entire island in shadow, an impenetrable darkness created by the tower's vigil over all of Libel... a vigil that prevents sunlight from ever reaching this island itself. Vedge approaches the tower, his worries mounting as high as the shadow cast by the massive edifice...  

Beginning:
Vedge: The Tower of the Mods is more intimidating than I could’ve imagined... I can't believe we're going to climb that thing, but we must. I cannot allow my mother's evil deeds to continue.
Null: Lord Vedge, we’ve got trouble!
Vedge: What is it, Null?!
Null: Unnamed Kingdom forces block the entrance to the Tower of the Mods!
Vedge: Blast! Get ready, everyone! Our fight to climb this tower truly begins here...

Chapter Won:
Vedge: We did it.
Null: Or did we?
Vedge: What do you mean, Null?
Null: The Unnamed Kingdom has sent a large army here. If we go into the tower now, we will be choked out quickly with no hope.
Vedge: You’re right. Tell everyone to take defensive positions in the courtyard. We must hold out this siege! Retreat is not an option!

Chapter 17:
(No opening or beginning, as this chapter immediately begins after the previous one)

Village 1:
Villager: We never thought this holy ground would become a place of war… Here, take this. May you end this conflict quickly...

Village 2:
Old man: For people like you to bring your war here, it is a disgrace! I never thought I’d see the day... Still, as much as I detest your fighting, my red roof dictates that I must not let you leave empty-handed, so take this. Godspeed to you, for godspeed means that I shall never see you again.

Chapter won:
Verge: The enemy is retreating…
Null: We’ve done iit! We’ve won!
Vedge: We have no time to waste! We must ascend the tower now!



Chapter 18:
Opening: Vedge has made it to the Tower of the Mods. At its highest room lies one of Libel's greatest secrets, the fabled Void Medallion. This medallion is said to bestow immense power upon those of the Crusader God Babby's bloodline. However, to access the medallion, one must both possess Major Babby Blood and successfully reach the top of the Tower while fending off the spiritual guardians that protect the sacred treasures that lie within. Among these treasures are numerous crests, the names of these crests known only to the gods themselves and the rulers of each kingdom. Even then, the ruler of each respective country knows only of the crest associated with their bloodline, and if there is no fabled crest to be associated with the royal family, no knowledge of these crests is passed down. Vedge now begins to climb this dreaded tower in hopes of obtaining the Void Medallion…

Beginning: 
Vedge: Finally, we’ve entered the Tower of the Mods… Everyone, stay sharp! Who knows what awaits us in here?

Chapter won:
Jane: So you've come…
Vedge: It's you again!
Jane: Indeed, it is I… And I suppose if you've made it this far, you've earned the right to know my real name. I am Vesta, the wife of the being you refer to as the “Crusader God”, Kaga.
Vedge: E-Excuse me? Wouldn't that would make you immortal?!
Vesta: In theory, yes. But the reality is not so simple...
Vedge: ???
Vesta: Confused, I see. Very well... Continue climbing the tower, Vedge. Successfully reach the next floor, and I will tell you everything.

Chapter 19:
(Chapters 19 and 20 are direct continuations of 18 and as such possess no openings, as the endings of the previous maps open the following ones)

Chapter Won:
Vesta: Made it this far, have you?
Vedge: Remember your promise, Vesta! You said you would tell me everything. Speak now, lest I cut you down!
Vesta: You wouldn't be able to if you tried. I am a ghost, after all.
Vedge: Charming. Could you get on with it?
Vesta: Such a gentleman... But very well; I'll start from the beginning. I'm sure you remember the great conflict with FEditior and the Donateenaries twenty years ago?
Vedge: Of course. The Donateenaries revived the Demon King FEditor in a long-term bid to resurrect the dark god Hex. What of it?
Vesta: Would you believe that, a mere twenty years before that, the Donateenaries won a similar war?
Vedge: What are you talking about?
Vesta: Ah, I see your knowledge of history matches most figments of this world.
Vedge: Figments? What in the gods' names are you talking about?!
Vesta: I shall explain. This world is not as old as you believe it to be. It, and many others like it were born in the aftermath of a disastrous event on the Motherworld 78 years prior in its timeline. In this disaster, the very fabric of reality itself was twisted, and as the threads that held this world together were split, ethereal spheres formed across time and space, and the aftereffects of the power generated by this reaction created unintended life in these spheres. As they effectively existed in a place designed to support life, all it took was something to kickstart that life. The Original God, creator of all things, was initially against allowing these life forms to exist. After all, they were formed by the sins of mankind; no good could come of it. However, my twin sister Ria was very much against destroying these nascent worlds of life. She begged for the Original God not to destroy the tiny spheres the humans had unknowingly created. The Original God agreed on one condition: that these “Outrealms", as they would come to be called, have their lives modeled after the imaginations of humans, with all the good and the bad that goes through the minds of humans to be represented in the world itself.
Vedge: Meaning?
Vesta: Meaning that whenever the human who owns a world is in a time of happiness, their world is peaceful. Sadness is a time of sorrow for that world's people, sickness unleashes a plague upon it, and as you may have gathered, internal turmoil leads to war. Always war. And as long as the human in question remains an imperfect human, they will continue to sin, which in turn creates more internal turmoil, which leads to more war for that world's people… 
Vedge: Can I stop this turmoil with the Void Medallion?
Vesta: No, the only way to stop war for good in these worlds is to destroy the world itself. When the human the world is tied too dies, the world dies with them.
Vedge: So all I can do is end this war?
Vesta: I'm afraid so… However, my sister and I both make our own efforts to ease people's turmoil with our own limited power, so the worlds we love may go without war longer.
Vedge: What are you anyway? You clearly aren't a ghost.
Vesta: Ahh yes, I am what is known as an angel, a servant of the Original God. I am here to inform you of these things, as well as the first task you should take upon obtaining the Void Medallion.
Vedge: Oh?
Vesta: Hehehe... Unlike a god, I am not perfect. I can very well lie to the likes of a being below the animals humans eat. Speak to me again after you obtain the Medallion. I'll be waiting.
Vedge: Wait!
 
Chapter 20:
(See Chapter 19 Clause)

Chapter Won:
Vesta: At last, you’ve made it to the top of the tower.
Vedge: Indeed. Now give me my medallion and explain my next goal.
Vesta: Very well, but before I do, know this. The Void Medallion, Water Crest, Earth Sigil, all of these items meant to unlock the power passed down through each bloodline, they were sealed here for good reason. Ultimate power ultimately corrupts, after all, and while using  this medallion will give you more than enough power to stand on equal footing with your mother, doing so will inevitably cause you to one day become as evil as her.
Vedge:... Can I defeat my mother without it?
Vesta: None can say. Your odds of success are substantially lower without using the medallion's power. I will say they are greater than zero, but still abysmally low.
Vedge: And if I use this power, someone will one day need to stop me?
Vesta: Yes. The next time turmoil erupts in the heart of the human who is connected to this world, there is no doubt you will be the aggressor.
Vedge: I see... Can I take the medallion now without using it?
Vesta: Yes. Keep it with you, and think on whether or not you must call upon its power.
Vedge: What should I do now that I have the Medallion?
Vesta: Go to the Republic of Spritans in the far north and seek the Blitz of Aja. The combined might of the Void Medallion and the Blitz of Aja will give you the greatest chance of success against Void. You will find the Blitz of Aja in possession of my sister, Ria.
Vedge: Very well.
Vesta: I shall warp you to the border of the Republic. The fate of the world is in your hands, Vedge; a great battle for the fate of all Libel awaits you.

Chapter 21:
Opening: Vedge has obtained the Void Medallion. With its power in hand, he heads north, seeking the divine treasure of the Angel Ria. This treasure, the Blitz of Aja, was previously unknown to Vedge, but he feels no reason to doubt Vesta's claims…

Beginning:
Verge: Milord, trouble afoot.
Vedge: What is it now?
Verge: The Spritans border guard is mobilizing, and they have already made motion to attack us.
Vedge: Dammit, Vesta... She warped us too close to the border to convince them we’re on their side. No matter! We'll seize the blasted border if we have to! Move!

Chapter Won:
Vedge: We are going to regret this later, aren't we?
Null: Not if we run like hell and leave no trace of our presence.
Vedge: Then let's find this “Blitz of Aja” and get out of here.
  
Chapter 22: (Darrman)
## Ch22Opening
Vedge's quest for the divine[N]
Blitz of Aja continues. Hearing[N]
rumors of a legendary Blitz,[AN]
his party travels to a remote[N]
town, far away from the Unnamed[N]
Kingdom's internal turmoil.[AN]
Tales of this Blitz's power[N]
can be heard from the farthest[N]
corners of the realm...[A][X]

## Ch22Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVerge]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVedge]
So, this is where that divine[N]
Blitz is meant to be lurking.[AN]
With it, perhaps I can devour[N]
anyone fool enough to face me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Milord, you're not alone in seeking[N]
this treasure. I have word of-[A]
[MidRight]
Don't bother me about competitors![N]
There's always competitors! And the[AN]
thing about competitors... is that[N]
they just get in my way! And the[AN]
power of the void will make short[N]
work of them. Any objections?[A]
[MidLeft]
No, milord. It's just... have you heard[N]
any laughing coming from the distance?[A][X]

## Ch22Opening3
[MidLeft][LoadKefka]
Hruh-huh-huh-huh! Clinging onto hope...[N]
Like there's any hope left in this world![AN]
And for my next trick, I will make this[N]
town... disappear![A][X]

## Ch22AfterPrepScreen
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVerge]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVedge]
I feel a disturbance in the sea...[N]
It's rising far faster than it should.[A]
[MidLeft]
Milord, there are monsters spawning[N]
out of the ruins to our north.[AN]
[Event]
First, someone needs to reach the switch[N]
inside this bar and block reinforcements.[AN]
[Event]
After that, you need to get to this house[N]
and open the way to that... clown.[AN]
The anti-flood defenses are located there[N]
so the water around him can be removed.[A]
[MidRight]
And what happens if we take too long?[A]
[MidLeft]
Then we get washed away, along with this[N]
town and the legendary Blitz. I'd say...[AN]
we have around [Red]twelve turns[Red] to win.[N]
Otherwise, all is lost, and the realm will-[A]
[MidRight]
Plunge into darkness? The only darkness[N]
is my own darkness! With the power of the[AN]
void... I will obtain this blitz, even if[N]
it costs me my sanity. I must. I shall.[A][X]


## SabinGet
[MidLeft][LoadSabin]
THIS is the legendary Blitz? This[N]
is no Blitz! This is an axe![AN]
Blitzes are not physical objects![N]
They're powerful techniques![AN]
You can't point at something and say[N]
"This is the Suplex". That doesn't[AN]
even make sense! At least I've gotten[N]
stronger at swinging these big axes...[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
Ah, the flood defenses! Time to flush[N]
Kefka out of his hiding place![A]
[MidLeft]
Kefka?!?! What's he doing here? Probably[N]
lured in by the rumors of power...[AN]
...power he's going to take for himself![N]
And with that power, lay waste to this[AN]
entire continent! My friends have only[N]
one mission: to stop his schemes and[AN]
restore balance to this world, bound[N]
for ruin! I will fight to preserve the[AN]
world, if you'll have me along. You[N]
will? Great! Time to pummel Kefka![A][X]

## ReinforcementsStopped
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][CurrentPortrait]
Well, that should take care of them.[A]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x5A][0x01]
Hey, what're you doin'? Don't[N]
push buttons randomly... That's[AN]
my job, you fool! Jobs, classes,[N]
commands... You should jump on[AN]
things, that's cool. Like a dragon[N]
plumber... Gimme another drink,[AN]
barman! Some nice cider- I mean coffee![N]
Coffee... Here, take this coffee...[AN]
It lets you take burning coffee and[N]
keep a hot hand... It's great![A][X]

## ArenaDestroyed
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKefka]
A monument to war? Hmm...[N]
I prefer a monument to nonexistence![A][X]

## TimeUp
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKefka]
Hruh-huh-huh-huh! So long, you[N]
sons of submariners! I hope you[AN]
enjoy the submarine life![A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
Damn it all! I'm going to be swept[N]
away! It's getting darker... Dark...[A][X]

## FinalPhase
[MidLeft][LoadVerge]
The water's starting to lap up on my[N]
feet! Finish this, and finish it NOW![A][X]

## Ch22Ending
[MidRight][LoadVedge]
And so, this "Legendary Blitz" was[N]
a Blitz Axe. Not a bad reward, really.[AN]
But it's not powerful enough to fight[N]
my mother. So long as she wields the[AN]
divine Super Blitz, no mortal's weapon[N]
can defeat her. One holy weapon...[AN]
... needs another holy weapon. It's[N]
as simple as that. Now, I need a boat.[A][X]

Chapter 23:
Opening: Disappointed by his findings, Vedge decides to return home. One way or another, he feels this long war will soon come to an end. After a month of traveling south, his party crosses into the Unnamed Kingdom's border and decides to rest at an old shrine…




Beginning: 
Vedge: Verge, have our scouts seen any enemies?
Verge: I'm afraid so, my lord.
Vedge: Then why are you just now telling me this?
Verge: Because with the medallion's power and the size of our ranks now, I do believe even surprise attacks can't stop us.
Vedge: You idiot! Give everyone the order to take position!
Verge: Yes, milord.

Chapter won
Vedge: See, Verge, this  is why even  with our newfound abilities, I still need to be informed of enemy movements. That fight would've gone much smoother had I been properly informed.
Verge: Yes, milord! It won't happen again!

Chapter 24:
Opening: Following the incident at Solomon Temple, Vedge's army begins its liberation campaign for the Unnamed Kingdom in earnest. For the following weeks, several battles were fought between the liberation army and the Unnamed Kingdom's knights. However despite their best efforts, the liberation army was losing, unable to match the raw numbers of the Unnamed Knights...

Beginning
Vedge: Gods above... look at all those soldiers.
Verge: There's so many, and our flanks have been cut off completely in our previous defeats…
Null: Is this… the end?
Vedge: No! I won't let it end like this. We must escape!
Verge: But to where?! We are quickly running out of options!
Vedge: The Northfort!
Null: What, the best-defended fort in the Unnamed Kingdom?! Surely you jest, sire?
Vedge: This is no jest, Null. The Northfort is the most populated fort in all of the unnamed kingdom. Attacking it sounds borderline suicidal, much more so attempting to flee there. If my mother thinks so as well, we have our opening.
Verge: This still sounds absurd...
Vedge: I know, but while this sounds absurd, I believe it to be the only open path to us remaining.
Null: Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? If we’re to die in battle, we may as well die with glory!

Village 1:
Villager: Things have been terrible since the Blitz War started. Queen Void levied an extreme “emergency tax” on everyone, and press-ganged anyone who could so much as hold a sword into service. There weren't enough farmers for the harvest this year because of this, and it looks as if the people might starve, but what does the Queen care? She has plenty of food in reserve. She won't feel the pain of starvation as we will, unless we become her personal slaves! Our sole hope was that the liberation army would succeed, but it's clear to us that they are on the verge of being crushed by the Unnamed Knights’ vast numbers… Oh, I shouldn't burden such kind visitors with my sorrow. Take this; I'm sure you will get much more use of it than I.

Village 2: 
Villager: I can't believe this war is happening. The country turned against its own self... It's so horrible! I… Ugh. My spirits may be with the rebellion but, UGH! GET AWAY FROM ME, YOU DOGS OF WAR! 
Visitor:... What's this?

Chapter Won:
Vedge: Come on, everyone! We must continue moving!


Chapter 25 (nyawenyye)
Opening: Vedge runs into the Northfort with his army, expecting to fight a huge battle with the full force of the Unnamed Kingdom's military. When they arrive at the gate of the castle, however, they find it open to them, without a single guard outside. With no other options, they head inside, confused…

Beginning:
Vedge - The gates are open… What could this mean?
Verge - I'm not sure. The Northfort should be the hardest fort to penetrate in all of the Unnamed Kingdom, and yet… We're standing right inside of it.
??? - Indeed you are.
Verge - Hmm? Show yourself, now!
Micheal P - SO, YOU MUST BE THE REBELLION I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.
Vedge - Who else would run blindly into this fort?
Micheal P - A FOOL. A LUCKY ONE, THOUGH. YOU'VE COME AT AN OPPORTUNE TIME, YOU SEE.
Verge - I'm afraid I don't recognize this man. Or his… odd way of speaking.
Micheal P - I NEED YOU TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR BATTLE. IMMEDIATELY. AT ANY TIME, THE GATES OF THIS CASTLE WILL BE BREACHED BY THE UNNAMED KINGDOM ONCE MORE, AND WE WILL HAVE TO MOUNT THE BEST DEFENSE WE CAN.
Verge - I still don't understand, though… How are you the only person here? How could you manage to capture the Northfort?
Micheal P - THIS FORT WAS ONCE MINE, AND I WAS ONCE OF THE UNNAMED KINGDOM. IT WAS NOT I WHO WISHED TO BE LIKE THIS, HOWEVER. I WAS TRAPPED, A BLOOD CONTRACT IN MY NAME BINDING ME TO THE ARMY OF THE KINGDOM I HATED SO MUCH. BUT NOW, I AM FREE. FREE TO FINALLY DO WHAT I'VE DREAMED OF FOR SO LONG.
Null - V- Vedge, sire! Enemies at the gates!
Micheal P - TODAY WE FIGHT THE MIGNON APOSTLE AND HIS ARMY, SUBJUGATED WILLINGLY UNDER THE UNNAMED KINGDOM IN SEARCH FOR MORE POWER. AND WE WILL REIGN VICTORIOUS.
Vedge - My ears…

Turn 1 Event:
Micheal P runs to the throne
Micheal P - MY AXE IS YOURS, VEDGE. DO NOT LET THEM REACH THE THRONE AREA OR ANYWHERE NEAR, OR THIS BATTLE IS GOOD AS LOST.
Vedge - I understand. Everyone, in position!


Chapter 26 (Alusq)
The party has two roads ahead of them: one through a pleasant meadow and the other through a cave system full of lava with a foreboding temple inside it. Ersatz suddenly appears and asks to lead the party through the lava cave because the meadow is an obvious trap. (If Ersatz is not alive, Vedge goes through the meadow only for the entire party to sink in quicksand and fall into the lava cave) Vedge agrees.
Already written in chapter*: As Vedge draws near to the temple, he feels a force pulling him forward and wanders ahead of the party. Dennis (who is back from the dead) appears and gloats that Vedge has fallen into his trap before unveiling a dragon zombie. Inferos, a demonic version of Vedge, suddenly appears, kills Dennis, and teleports Vedge and himself into the middle of the temple. Walls appear to block Vedge's escape, but Vedge has an edgy moment and his willpower causes the walls to crack, enabling the rest of the party to come to his rescue if he is not strong enough to defeat the boss.
Already written end of chapter*: Vedge declares that there can be only one Vedge in this world and the party exits the lava cave.

Chapter 27:
Opening: Vedge has conquered his inner demons. Now, he moves towards the Unnamed Capital of the Unnamed Kingdom. To get there and fulfill his destiny, he must first cross the shifting desert sands, a magic-born protective barrier separating the Unnamed Kingdom from its capital. The final hurdle before the final showdown is before Vedge. Will he survive?

Beginning:
Vedge: This desert always reassured me as a kid... My guardian angel of sorts. And now, look at it! It is now my greatest adversary... I must be ready. Once we cross this desert, we will be at the capital where the final battle awaits us!

Village:
We're saved! Even after the Crusader God Babby himself betrayed the Queen due to her terror, her Super Blitz Lance made her on par with the Crusader God… We escaped to this village to avoid the ensuing war. Please, you must go to the Crusader God's aid! Take this. It will help you  on your way.

Chapter Won:
Vedge: … Is everyone ready? Because now, we end it all. May the final battle begin!

Chapter 28:
Opening: Dawn breaks on a new day, a day much like any other. However, on this day, the final showdown of this long war begins. The Crusader God Babby, the original founder of the Unnamed Kingdom, stands in rebellion to Vedge's mother and enemy, Void, and has secured the castle. Vedge's best chance is to meet up in the castle with the Crusader God himself to take over the capital. However, Void has prepared for this possibility, and has summoned four knights of unparalleled strength and power. These knights, known as the Lords of Light and Shadow, are the finest in all lands, and pose a great threat to Vedge. Can Vedge win?

Beginning:
Vedge: The unnamed capital… I'm coming mother. Coming to put an end to this.
Verge: Milord, our scouts have returned. They've confirmed that while the castle is completely surrounded by the Lords of Light and Shadow, the castle itself is under the control of the Crusader God Babby.
Null: It is? Don't tell me we have to fight one of the Crusader Gods?!
Verge: No, the Crusader God stands against Queen Void. He is an ally.
Vedge: Are you serious?
Verge: Yes, and he seeks to provide his strength to you sire, but he cannot do that without meeting you directly.
Vedge: So we move to the castle.
Verge: Yes, and as quickly as possible.
Vedge: Even so, there may be some things we can get done out here before we visit the castle(Put “Visit the Castle” in red text please). I have a feeling we won't get another chance once we do so.
Verge: Indeed. There may be something very important here, but if we go to the castle now, any chance we we had at obtaining it will be lost.

North Village: We're saved! If you could lead us to our fathers, I'm sure they will be very glad!
(Three Citizens Spawn)

Flagged kid meets up with their assigned dev:
Kid: Father!
If Sakaguchi:
Sakaguchi: Final Fantasy! You're safe! Now I can join Vedge's army, but... hmm… I doubt the others will join even if their kids are saved for balancing reasons.

If Kojima:
Kojima: Metal Gear! How many times have I told you! I'm tired of working on you! You don’t have to be my child anymore! Ugh. I guess I'll join Vedge's army now. Not like I have anything else to do.

If Iga:
Iga: Bloodstained! It is you! Now that you are safe, I may join Lord Vedge. It’s a shame we cannot save the others.

 South Village:
(PLACEHOLDER until I confirm its function)

If Inafune event triggered: 
Inafune: Alright, alright, you've convinced me. I'll fight for you. Although, this means none of the others will join you. Here, have some pizza; it'll cheer you up. What do you mean, it won't? It's better than nothing, isn't it?
Event Triggerer: No
Inafune: Now listen here, you little ingrate. Do you know why you don't appreciate this pizza? It's because the pizza industry is finished and you refuse to open your eyes to this fact! I went to the calzone industry convention last year, and all the calzone makers were putting out new calzones with interesting new flavors while the pizza industry still remains stuck in its old ways! The pizza industry needs to open itself to innovation or die, and mark my words, you pizza people are running out of time. A decade from now, you'll all be history and the calzone people are going to be dancing on your grave... PIZZA'S grave! MARK! MY! WORDS!

All Houses unless used for Inafune Event:
Visitor: Hmm… The people living here must have already evacuated.

Chapter won:
Babby: So you made it.
Vedge: My Lord. I thank you for rebelling.
Babby: It is fine. Now let us secure the town proper. This battle is not over yet.
Vedge: Of course!

Chapter 29:
Opening: 
It has been a year and a half since Vedge returned home, and ever since, the capital has been a warzone. Now, with his army scattered across the capital, Vedge must hold out until one of the two armies falls…

Beginning:
Vedge: Everyone! The next wave of their assault is incoming! Let’s move!
Null: My friend, we are cut off from the Crusader God!
(Cut to Babby)
Babby: *Is adorable amidst the chaos*
(Return to Vedge)
Vedge: No! If he dies, it’s all over... Protect Babby, as well as the castle, at all costs!

Both Villages:
Visitor: No one here?... Well, I suppose we are in the midst of a struggle of cataclysmic proportions. The former residents of this house likely have far greater things to worry about than someone taking… hmmm… this thing!

(I’ll let Doc handle Babby’s recruitment)

Chapter Won:
Vedge: They just keep coming!... Screw it! Lead them to the Forbidden Peak! We’ll settle this there.

Final Chapter:
Opening: The Final Battle begins atop the forbidden peak overlooking the bloodsoaked capital of the Forbidden Kingdom. On this day, nearly 3 years from the day the bloody “War of Oblivion” started, the war will finally come to an end…

Beginning: 
Vedge: Mother! We settle this here!
Void: Vedge, you have come a long way. If you weren’t attempting to kill me, I would be proud of you… I never would have expected to need to assemble my old army anew to fight off my own flesh and blood.
Vedge: Mother… I… Let’s do this…
Void: Hmph. Leeroy, are you ready?
Leeroy: Indeed, my love. Let’s put our greatest mistake out of its misery!
Void: EVERYONE, WE FIGHT!
Vedge: EVERYONE, TOGETHER WE RIDE! TO VICTORY!

Luut vs. Doot:
Luut: Doot! I’ve finally found you! Snap out of it, please!
Doot: Snap out of what?! I’m here of my own free will, aren’t you?
Luut: Yes, I am. I came here to save you, because I figured you had to be brainwashed to get press-ganged into service here!
Doot: I can’t believe you thought I was brainwashed. That’s it! You’re going down!
Luut: Can you blame-
Doot: Who the fu-
Luut: LANGUAGE!
Doot: Whom the fu-
Luut: NOOOO! Time for your nap!

Doot if defeated by someone other than Luut:
Doot: No no no! It can’t end… like this…

Doot if defeated by Luut:
Doot: I…
Luut: Hold still. I have to stop the bleeding.
Doot: But I… I tried to kill you! Why are you trying to save me?
Luut: Family is family.

Vs. Kaga
Kaga: Fools who do not understand my works... Prepare to meet your maker!


Kaga vs. Sakaguchi
Sakaguchi: Kaga, what’s happened to you?
Kaga: Sakaguchi, long time no see, old friend. I can’t say I expected to see you on their side.
Sakaguchi: It’s a long story…
Kaga: Save it. If you fight for them, you fight for the husk of a series Fire Emblem has become.
Sakaguchi: No. I fight for the legacy of your series.
Kaga: What “legacy”?! My series died the second they tossed a self-insert into one of my games, not to mention the atrocities of Awakening and Fates! Such horrible things deserve nothing more than death. You should know this as well as anyone. 
Sakaguchi: This army saved Final Fantasy... It can save Fire Emblem too!
Kaga: Then prove it to me in single combat!
Sakaguchi: Very well, old friend.

Kaga killed:
Kaga: No… I’ve failed you, Tearring. I’ve… failed...

Kaga defeated by Sakaguchi:
Kaga: I see your resolve, my friend.
Sakaguchi: Do you?
Kaga: I do. While I am unable to help with these wounds, I will live, and we will work to make a legacy we can be proud of together.
Sakaguchi: I am looking forward to it.

Tiki Boss Quote:
Stay away!

Tiki defeated quote:
Mar-Mar…

Tiki defeated with FE3 Anna:
Tiki: Stay…
Anna: Poor thing! Jake told me about you. I think I’ll save you. Maybe I can squeeze a pretty penny out of Prince Marth for this...


Talk with any of the enemy Annas:
Anna: If you’d rather not fight me, well, have I got the deal for you! I’ll leave for a small fee of 20,000 gold. Well? What do you say?
(If paid, the talked-to Anna will leave the map)

(Defeat Jay with Boo to save Jay/get Darr to write these people I do not know)

If Evil Florina is talked to by someone carrying five staves:
Evil Florina: Oh?! I see you too are a fan of fancy staves. I’ll make you a deal. I’ll take the staves and leave the battlefield, and you will have one less threat to deal with. Thanks for the trade!

Vs. Leeroy
If  Vedge: 
Leeroy: My son... Let’s end this.
Vedge: Father… No mercy!!

Normal Boss Quote:
Leeroy: Hmph! I shall not allow anyone to quash my darling’s innermost ambitions. Die!

Vedge vs Kaga:
Vedge: It... It can’t be… Even so, I will not let anyone bar my path, not even Kaga himself!

Vs Void:
Void: The Donateenaries are a blight upon this world. You aim to propagate this blight, and so you must die.

Vedge vs Void:
Void: I raised you, I loved you; I’ve given you weapons, endowed you with knowledge... There is nothing left for me to give you.
Vedge: Mother…
Void: I gave you all of this, and yet you betrayed me… I was going to give you the world.
Vedge: I don’t care. You are just causing Libel’s cycle of war to repeat! I must stop you!
Void: Am I? If I recall correctly, the one who started this rebellion, and by extension this whole war, was you.
Vedge: I would not have needed to rebel had you not been trying to starve out an entire people, killing the ones who resisted!
Void: Indeed, but at the end of the day, had you accepted my love and let them die with their god, this “cycle of war” would not exist. And yet here we are, your axe upon my lance… One final holy blitz.
Vedge: This ends now!

Null vs Void:
Void: Hmph. Donateenary trash, human refuse. If I have made any mistake, it was allowing you and your sister into my son’s life.
Null: Where is she?
Void: In refusal to pay the Donateenary Tax, she committed high treason. The punishment for treason is, as you know, death.
Null: YOU DIE HERE!

Void’s Death Quote:
Void: So ends my story... But know this: my will shall never die. As long as the Donateenaries exist, Libel will know war; war heralded by a matricidal god, whose judgement is no better than theirs and no match for mine... I know this well, Vedge. War will always return; it is our heritage, our destiny, and you know it. You... have already spoken with Vesta. You know… that more conflict will come. You know… you… have wasted… your time…

"save Everyone" event triggered by talking to Void with Vedge without moving any other units 
Void: My son… Why won’t you attack?
Vedge: Mother… Let’s stop this fighting. I understand now. I’ll become the next Blitz and stamp


Chapter won:
(MGS3 Ending Theme plays in background)
Vedge: ... It’s over.
Null: Vedge…
Vedge: Null, I’m leaving. Do me a favor and tell Verge I leave this kingdom to him.
Null: But it’s your birthright, Vedge! You-
Vedge: I’m damn well aware of my birth! After all, my mother just died because of it. How can I rule this kingdom when I played a large part in dragging it all to hell?
Null: So where are you heading?
Vedge: I haven’t a clue... Probably somewhere I can be alone for a while. With any luck, the winner of this war not seizing power may be enough to prevent the cycle from repeating.
Null: I understand your reasoning. I don’t like it, but I understand.
Vedge: Let us never forget this war, Null; it is the greatest tragedy ever to befall this world. We must strive to make the Libel a better place. As it has been said, and as it shall be said… ultimate power ultimately corrupts. (Sound of blade hitting ground [dunno about this; this is pretty hard to depict in GBA sound effects alone]) And because of this, I vow never to use this power again. I hereby renounce my birthright, and with it the ability to make war! Never again shall I pick up this axe! No more violence... No more tears. Together, we shall create our own bright future!
