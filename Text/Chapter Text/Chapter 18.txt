## Ch18Narration
Vedge has made it to the Tower[N]
of the Mods. At its highest room[AN]
lies one of Libel's greatest[N]
secrets, the fabled Void[AN]
Medallion. This medallion is[N]
said to bestow immense power[AN]
upon those of the Crusader God[N]
Babby's bloodline. However, to[AN]
access the medallion, one must[N]
both possess Major Babby Blood[AN]
and successfully reach the top[N]
of the Tower while fending off[AN]
the spiritual guardians that[N]
protect the sacred treasures[AN]
that lie within. Among these[N]
treasures are numerous crests,[AN]
the names of these crests[N]
known only to the gods themselves[AN]
and the rulers of each kingdom.[N]
Even then, the ruler of each[AN]
respective country knows only[AN]
of the crest associated with[N]
their bloodline, and if there[AN]
is no fabled crest to be[N]
associated with the royal family,[AN]
no knowledge of these crests is [N]
passed down. Vedge now begins to[AN]
climb this dreaded tower in hopes [N]
of obtaining the Void Medallion...[AN][X]

[MidLeft][LoadMystery]
#Vesta being an NPC, there isn't a portrait yet.
So you've come...[N]
[MidRight]
It's you again![N]
[MidLeft]
Indeed, it is I...[N]
And I suppose if you've made[AN]
it this far, you've earned[N]
the right to know my real[AN]
name. I am Vesta, the wife[N]
of the being you refer to[AN]
as the [0x93]Crusader God[0x94], Kaga.[AN]
[MidRight]
E-Excuse me? Wouldn't that[N]
make you immortal?![AN]
[MidLeft]
In theory, yes. But the[N]
reality is not so simple...[AN]
[MidRight]
Huh???[N]
[MidLeft]
Confused, I see. Very well...[N]
Continue climbing the tower,[AN]
Vedge. Successfully reach the[N]
next floor, and I will tell[AN]
you everything.[A][X]
