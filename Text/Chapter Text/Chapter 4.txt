## Chapter4_Intro
Following Vedge's successful[N]
pacification of the town of[AN]
Script's periphery, he heads[N]
deeper into the city in hopes of[AN]
ending the rebels who attacked[N]
his home. A great battle awaits[AN]
him there...[A][X]

## Chapter4_Beginning
[.v....][LoadVerge]
[....v.][LoadVedge]
The enemy has already taken position?[A]

[.v....]
Yes, milord. It would seem[N]
this part of the town is[AN]
the last stronghold of the[N]
Donateenary clan in this city.[AN]
Once we defeat them, our[N]
pacification of Script[AN]
will be complete.[A]

[....v.]
Good![N]
Then let's free this town.[A][X]

## Chapter4_LeftVillage
[....v.][LoadCurrent]
[.v....][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
I can't believe this war[N]
is happening. As poor a ruler[AN]
Queen Void has been, I never[N]
would have contemplated rebellion.[AN]
Oh, if only the good King Abyss[N]
were here[Beat] He was such[AN]
a fine king. I was given this[N]
by him before his demise at[AN]
the hands of the Donateenaries.[N]
Take it; having something[AN]
signaling I support the royal[N]
family is dangerous these days[Beat][A][X]

## Chapter4_RightVillage
[....v.][LoadCurrent]
Hm? Who left this thing here?[AN]
I suppose no one would mind[N]
if I were to take it[Beat][A][X]

## Chapter4_Ending
[.v....][LoadNull]
[.....v][LoadVerge]
[...v..][LoadVedge]
[Beat] [Beat][A]

[.v....]
Vedge, are you alright?[A]

[...v..]
I'm fine, Null. I just[Beat][N]
didn't realize the discontent[AN]
with my mother was so[N]
widespread. Those men, they[AN]
fought with honor despite[N]
being rebels, and they must[AN]
have had good reason to do so[Beat][A]

[.....v]
Sire, worry not about the[N]
personal lives of our enemy.[AN]
They would not show you the[N]
same courtesy. Besides, we[AN]
must move out posthaste:[N]
your mother has requested[AN]
our presence in the region[N]
of Dark Sanctity.[A]

[...v..]
Dark Sanctity? Mother and I[N]
used to go there for vacation[AN]
when I was a child[Beat][N]
Let's go.[A][X]

## Chapter4_Objective
Kill the local Donateenary[N]
rebel ring leaders.[X]

## Chapter4_Goal
 Defeat Bosses[X]
