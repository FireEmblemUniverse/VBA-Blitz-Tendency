Sire, there seems to be two paths.[N]
We could take a nice relaxing[AN]
walk through the the meadows,[N]
or we could enter this scary[AN]
cave that's probably full of[N]
lava that burns everything[AN]
it touches to ash. I'd reckon[N]
there's probably a cultist's[AN]
lair buried in there for good[N]
measure. In other words, it's[AN]
a terrible idea to go there.[N]
I could do with a relaxing walk[AN]
myself. I'm sick of marching.[A]
[MidRight]
We could bathe ourselves in[N]
darkness, or we could run[AN]
in the light to reach our[N]
destination quicker. Let[AN]
the army frolick in the[N]
fields. It will help morale.[AN][X]

Milord! That pleasant meadow...[N]
is nothing by a sinister trap![A]
[MidRight]
Wha-? Ersatz? What are you[N]
doing here? And what are[AN]
you talking about? I don't[N]
see anything wrong at all.[AN]
[FarLeft]
This is just another one of[N]
Dennis's diabolical schemes![AN]
He snares any unsuspecting[N]
travellers wandering the[AN]
meadows... and then...[AN]
[MidRight]
Sir, Dennis died a long time[N]
ago. I doubt any of his traps[AN]
are still active. There's[N]
really nothing to worry about.[AN]
[FarLeft]
That's just what Dennis wants[N]
you to think! An empty field[AN]
in a war zone? Such a painfully[N]
trap. The safest option for us[AN]
to travel through that cave![N]
No self-respecting army would[AN]
ever march through one.[N]
We'll catch him completely[AN]
off guard! Once we've him[N]
outsmarted...[AN]
[MidRight]
Very well. Men! We march[N]
through this cave![AN][X]

Across the plains...[N]
Oh no![MoveMidRight] Quicksand! Ahh![AN][X]

## Ch26Opening3
{OpenMidRight][LoadVedge]
There's something about this[N]
cave... I just have to go[AN]
and explore it thoroughly.[N]
It's just so intriguing...[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][Dennis][0x01]
Ahahaha... You have fallen[N]
right into my trap![AN][X]

## Ch26Opening4
[MidLeft][LoadFace][Dennis][0x01]
{LoadMidRight][LoadVedge]
Dennis?! I thought you were[N]
dead! How are you still alive?![AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, don't fuss about the[N]
details. The important[AN]
part is you fell into my[N]
trap. You don't have any[N]
of your friends to help[AN]
you out. You're on your[N]
own, Vedge... Now meet[AN]
my pet. Draco, come![A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadFace][Dennis][0x01]
He's hungry, you know.[N]
That quicksand pit was my[AN]
stealthiest, sneakiest,[N]
and slimiest trick! Ahahaha![A]
[MidRight]
Oh... a dragon zombie.[N]
Where have I seen those?[AN]
Ahh. I'm so scared. Help.[AN]
[FarFarLeft][Invert]
Hold it.[A][X]

#The amount of missing portraits here is kind of astounding.
Kehkehkeh... I am Infernos...[N]
I am... your worst nightmare...[AN]
And I... am the... true heir...[N]
to the divine... Blitz of Aja![AN]
You... are a mere... pretender.[N]
An usurper... and you cannot...[AN]
get away. No... matter... what.[N]
Do you have... any last words?[AN][X]

## Ch26Opening7
[MidLeft][LoadMystery]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVedge]
Last words? No, demon. I don't.[N]
This temple is not my grave.[AN]
You may consider yourself a[N]
superior being. You think you[AN]
have me trapped. But you don't.[N]
I have the power of the Void[AN]
Medallion on my side. With it,[N]
I can shatter these walls![AN][X]

## Ch26Ending
{LoadMidRight][LoadVedge]
There's only room for one[N]
Vedge in this town...[AN][X]
