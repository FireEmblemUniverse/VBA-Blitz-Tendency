#Chapter 26 (Alusq)
#There was never any actual script.
#There are notes, so I'll	 just make something up using them.
#The party has two roads ahead of them: one through a pleasant meadow and the other through a cave system full of lava with a foreboding temple inside it. Ersatz suddenly appears and asks to lead the party through the lava cave because the meadow is an obvious trap. (If Ersatz is not alive, Vedge goes through the meadow only for the entire party to sink in quicksand and fall into the lava cave) Vedge agrees.
#Already written in chapter*: As Vedge draws near to the temple, he feels a force pulling him forward and wanders ahead of the party. Dennis (who is back from the dead) appears and gloats that Vedge has fallen into his trap before unveiling a dragon zombie. Inferos, a demonic version of Vedge, suddenly appears, kills Dennis, and teleports Vedge and himself into the middle of the temple. Walls appear to block Vedge's escape, but Vedge has an edgy moment and his willpower causes the walls to crack, enabling the rest of the party to come to his rescue if he is not strong enough to defeat the boss.
#Already written end of chapter*: Vedge declares that there can be only one Vedge in this world and the party exits the lava cave.

Sire, there seems to be two paths.[N]
We could take a nice relaxing[AN]
walk through the the meadows,[N]
or we could enter this scary[AN]
cave that's probably full of[N]
lava that burns everything[AN]
it touches to ash. I'd reckon[N]
there's probably a cultist's[AN]
lair buried in there for good[N]
measure. In other words, it's[AN]
a terrible idea to go there.[N]
I could do with a relaxing walk[AN]
myself. I'm sick of marching.[A]
[MidRight]
We could bathe ourselves in[N]
darkness, or we could run[AN]
in the light to reach our[N]
destination quicker. Let[AN]
the army frolick in the[N]
fields. It will help morale.[AN][X]

Milord! That pleasant meadow...[N]
is nothing by a sinister trap![A]
[MidRight]
Wha-? Ersatz? What are you[N]
doing here? And what are[AN]
you talking about? I don't[N]
see anything wrong at all.[AN]
[FarLeft]
This is just another one of[N]
Dennis's diabolical schemes![AN]
He snares any unsuspecting[N]
travellers wandering the[AN]
meadows... and then...[AN]
[MidRight]
Sir, Dennis died a long time[N]
ago. I doubt any of his traps[AN]
are still active. There's[N]
really nothing to worry about.[AN]
[FarLeft]
That's just what Dennis wants[N]
you to think! An empty field[AN]
in a war zone? Such a painfully[N]
trap. The safest option for us[AN]
to travel through that cave![N]
No self-respecting army would[AN]
ever march through one.[N]
We'll catch him completely[AN]
off guard! Once we've him[N]
outsmarted...[AN]
[MidRight]
Very well. Men! We march[N]
through this cave![AN][X]

Across the plains...[N]
Oh no![MoveMidRight] Quicksand! Ahh![AN][X]

## Ch26Opening3
{LoadMidRight][LoadVedge]
There's something about this[N]
cave... I just have to go[AN]
and explore it thoroughly.[N]
It's just so intriguing...[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][Dennis][0x01]
Ahahaha... You have fallen[N]
right into my trap![AN][X]

## Ch26Opening4
[MidLeft][LoadFace][Dennis][0x01]
{LoadMidRight][LoadVedge]
Dennis?! I thought you were[N]
dead! How are you still alive?![AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, don't fuss about the[N]
details. The important[AN]
part is you fell into my[N]
trap. You don't have any[N]
of your friends to help[AN]
you out. You're on your[N]
own, Vedge... Now meet[AN]
my pet. Draco, come![A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadFace][Dennis][0x01]
He's hungry, you know.[N]
That quicksand pit was my[AN]
stealthiest, sneakiest,[N]
and slimiest trick! Ahahaha![A]
[MidRight]
Oh... a dragon zombie.[N]
Where have I seen those?[AN]
Ahh. I'm so scared. Help.[AN]
[FarFarLeft][Invert]
Hold it.[A][X]

#The amount of missing portraits here is kind of astounding.
Kehkehkeh... I am Infernos...[N]
I am... your worst nightmare...[AN]
And I... am the... true heir...[N]
to the divine... Blitz of Aja![AN]
You... are a mere... pretender.[N]
An usurper... and you cannot...[AN]
get away. No... matter... what.[N]
Do you have... any last words?[AN][X]

[LoadMidRight][LoadVedge]
Last words? No, demon. I don't.[N]
This temple is not my grave.[AN]
You may consider yourself a[N]
superior being. You think you[AN]
have me trapped. But you don't.[N]
I have the power of the Void[AN]
Medallion on my side. With it,[N]
I can shatter these walls![AN][X]

## Ch26Ending

There's only room for one[N]
