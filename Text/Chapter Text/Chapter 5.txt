## Chapter5_Intro
The River known as Dark Sanctity[N]
was known for many horrific[AN]
battles once waged there. It is[N]
said all wars in the history[AN]
of Libel, in some manner or[N]
another, started on the banks[AN]
of this river. Despite this, the[N]
river's majestic sheen and[AN]
historical relevance made it a[N]
popular vacation destination[AN]
among the people of the Nameless[N]
Kingdom, and in peaceful times,[AN]
there is no more pleasant place[N]
on the globe. Unfortunately, the[AN]
river's sinister propensity to[N]
spark conflicts was about to[AN]
rear its ugly head once again...[A][X]

## Chapter5_Beginning
[...v..][LoadVedge]
[.....v][LoadNull]
[.v....][LoadVoid]
You have done well, my son.[N]
I am proud of you.[A]

[...v..]
Mother, this has been bothering[N]
me too much. These rebels have[AN]
rebelled because of your taxation[N]
on the Donateenary people! They[AN]
decided to fight despite knowing[N]
there was no way they could win...[AN]
Please, tell me, what role does[N]
justice play in these stringent[AN]
policies?! With taxes so high,[N]
they cannot afford to live![A]

[.v....]
You're right; they can't.[N]
That's kind of the point.[A]

[.....v]
What?![A]

[.v....]
The Donateenaries are a horrible[N]
people who seek the revival of[AN]
a wicked god. This ambition of[N]
theirs led Libel to a horrific war[AN]
twenty years ago that started on[N]
this very soil[Beat] The war that[AN]
killed your grandparents. Such a[N]
people should not be allowed to exist.[A]

[...v..]
Unless they willingly do[N]
whatever you say.[A]

[.v....]
What?![A]

[...v..]
Null and Nada are commoners who[N]
descend from the Donateenaries![AN]
You told me as much yourself[N]
five years ago![A]

[.....v]
I told you- what?![A]

[...v..]
If such a people are truly[N]
innately corrupt, why would[AN]
you allow me to marry one[N]
into our household?[A]

[.v....]
I shall fix that mistake very[N]
shortly. If you descend from[AN]
the Donateenaries, you must die.[N]
You just had to figure it all out,[AN]
didn't you, Vedge?[A]

[...v..]
In that case, I will lead the[N]
rebellion against you! Stealing[AN]
the lives of so many without[N]
giving them a chance to atone[AN]
is something I cannot allow![A]

[.v....]
You would defy me directly?![N]
The punishment for treason is[AN]
death!! All units, teach this[N]
boy some manners! Leave not[AN]
a man alive! I must return to[N]
the castle for now.[A]

[...v..]
Bring it on, Mom! Just try and[N]
stop my fight for this righteous[AN]
cause. When I'm finished, this[N]
will be a land where genocide[AN]
is not tolerated![A][X]


## Ch5OpenningText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVedge]
What? There's no bridge? Looks[NL]
like we have a fight on our[A][NL]
hands regardless.[A][X]

## Ch5VillageText
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadXimena]
Who are you? I bet you're looking for[NL]
a way across, aren't you? Sorry, but[A][NL]
I don't think you'll be able to find[NL]
it here... or anywhere within three[A][NL]
days distance upstream or downstream.[NL]
See, my ancestors here were persecuted[A][NL]
relentlessly by mauraders across the[NL]
stream, [.]and-[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look. I don't care. Just[NL]
tell us the best way across.[A][NL]
It's very important.[A][CloseSpeech]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
Important you say? Go to the temple[NL]
just west of here. Just inside, you[A][NL]
will find a chest with an artifact.[NL]
Bring that artifact to the water,[A][NL]
and the path will be clear. Ximena[NL]
will show you the way.[A][Events][CloseSpeech][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenLeft][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadXimena]
Grandmother, we can't infiltrate[NL]
the sanctity of the temple. You[A][NL]
know that better than anyone![A][CloseSpeech][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Child, they are clearly on an an[NL]
important quest. Those bandits[A][NL]
left decades ago. There is[NL]
no danger anymore whatsoever.[A]
[OpenRight]But-[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Take this and go![A][X]

## Ch5ArtifactGotText
[OpenLeft][LoadXimena]
Now that we have the artifact[NL]
grandmother says all we need[A][NL]
to do is bring it near the water.[NL]
Over there should do, I suppose.[A][X]

## Ch5MakeBridgeText
[OpenLeft][LoadXimena]
Incredible! You should be[NL]
able to cross now![A][X]

## Chapter5_Ending
[.v....][LoadNull]
[.....v][LoadVerge]
[...v..][LoadVedge]
I[Beat] can't believe I just did that.[A]

[.....v]
Sire, we must get moving.[A]

[...v..]
Verge, everyone, why did you[N]
continue to support me?![AN]
You should've stopped me! I[Beat][A]

[.v....]
We can discuss that later![N]
For the moment, we must fly![A]

[...v..]
Nowhere in the Nameless Kingdom[N]
will be safe[Beat] Where should we go?[A]

[.....v]
My parents were born in[N]
the kingdom of Kagavesta.[AN]
They live there even today,[N]
as advisors to the land's king.[AN]
Perhaps we can seek counsel[N]
from them.[A]

[...v..]
To Kagavesta, then![A][X]

## Ch5BattleDoneText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVedge][OpenMidRight][LoadXimena]
Incredible. Our legends tell of[NL]
something forged to keep the water[A][NL]
level up for our protection. I[NL]
had no idea that it still existed.[A][NL]
We have no need for it now.[NL]
You keep it. Hold it, and it[A][NL]
will make you stronger.[A][X]

## Ch5BanditText
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x4C][0x01]
Look, boys! Here's our chance![NL]
Sack the village! No survivors![A][X]

## Ch5VillageGoneText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVedge][OpenMidRight][LoadXimena]
My home! Grandmother![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You clearly have a[NL]
conflicted past now. You[A][NL]
sound like a good character[NL]
for our party. What say you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm hesitent, but there's[NL]
nothing else to do, so okay.[A][X]
