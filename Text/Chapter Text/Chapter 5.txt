What? There's no bridge? Looks[NL]
like we have a fight on our[A][NL]
hands regardless.[A][X]

Who are you? I bet you're looking for[NL]
a way across, aren't you? Sorry, but[A][NL]
I don't think you'll be able to find[NL]
it here... or anywhere within three[A][NL]
days distance upstream or downstream.[NL]
See, my ancestors here were persecuted[A][NL]
relentlessly by mauraders across the[NL]
stream, [.]and-[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look. I don't care. Just[NL]
tell us the best way across.[A][NL]
It's very important.[A][CloseSpeech]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
Important you say? Go to the temple[NL]
just west of here. Just inside, you[A][NL]
will find a chest with an artifact.[NL]
Bring that artifact to the water,[A][NL]
and the path will be clear. Ximena[NL]
will show you the way.[A][Events][CloseSpeech][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenLeft][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadXimena]
Grandmother, we can't infiltrate[NL]
the sanctity of the temple. You[A][NL]
know that better than anyone![A][CloseSpeech][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Child, they are clearly on an an[NL]
important quest. Those bandits[A][NL]
left decades ago. There is[NL]
no danger anymore whatsoever.[A]
[OpenRight]But-[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Take this and go![A][X]

Now that we have the artifact[NL]
grandmother says all we need[A][NL]
to do is bring it near the water.[NL]
Over there should do, I suppose.[A][X]

## Ch5MakeBridgeText
[OpenLeft][LoadXimena]
Incredible! You should be[NL]
able to cross now![A][X]

## Ch5BattleDoneText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVedge][OpenMidRight][LoadXimena]
Incredible. Our legends tell of[NL]
something forged to keep the water[A][NL]
level up for our protection. I[NL]
had no idea that it still existed.[A][NL]
We have no need for it now.[NL]
You keep it. Hold it, and it[A][NL]
will make you stronger.[A][X]

[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x4C]
Look, boys! Here's our chance![NL]
Sack the village! No survivors![A][X]

## Ch5VillageGoneText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVedge][OpenMidRight][LoadXimena]
My home! Grandmother![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You clearly have a[NL]
conflicted past now. You[A][NL]
sound like a good character[NL]
for our party. What say you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm hesitent, but there's[NL]
nothing else to do, so okay.[A][X]
