## Chapter10Opening
The Tower of the Mods.[N]
Resting on an island separate[AN]
from the mainland, this tower[N]
overlooks all of Libel.[AN]
It is said the Crusader Gods[N]
live in this place, watching[AN]
over the many countries of[N]
the vast continent. Vedge,[AN]
in an effort to defeat his[N]
mother, must now journey to[AN]
this tower and obtain one of[N]
the fabled treasures said to be[AN]
hidden within, the Void Medallion.[N]
On his way there he passes a[AN]
town named Lakeside, occupied by[N]
Unnamed Kingdom forces instead[AN]
of the Kagavestan troops that [N]
should have resided there...[A][X]

[.v....][LoadVerge]
[....v.][LoadVedge]

[.v....]
Trouble is abrew, milord. Unnamed[n]
Kingdom forces are mobilizing![a]
[....v.]
What? But this is a Kagavestan[n]
city. What are my mother's troops[an]
doing here?[a]
[.v....]
They must have invaded during[n]
the confusion at the castle.[a]
[....v.]
Then we'll seize this whole[n]
city! Everyone, let's march![a]
[.v....]
I have a bad feeling about[n]
this, milord. The tides in[an]
this region are known to[n]
be volatile.[a]
[....v.]
Then let's capture the city[n]
before it's too late![A][X]

## Chapter10Ending
[...v..][LoadVedge]
How could Kagavesta be so[N]
crippled after a single defeat?[AN]
Where are its people? Come to[N]
think of it, the royal family[AN]
was absent from the castle[Beat][N]
Why aren't they doing something?[AN]
It's almost like the majority of[N]
the nation has vanished[Beat][AN]
But why?[A][X]

the Unnameds[X]
