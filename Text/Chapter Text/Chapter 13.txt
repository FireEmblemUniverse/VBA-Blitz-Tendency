I've always hated this cave.[AN]
[..v...]
I care nothing for it as well,[N]
my lord. This heat is appalling.[AN]
[.v....]
Milord, Unnamed Kingdom[N]
forces approach![AN]
[....v.]
Well, time to see how[N]
much heat we can take![A][X]

[.v....][LoadMystery]
Excuse me, sir. What is one[N]
such as yourself doing[AN]
in such an unholy place?[AN]
[....v.]
I could ask you the[n]
same question.[AN]
[.v....]
Fair enough! My tale is a[N]
fairly simple one: a thief[AN]
stole everything I own and[N]
left me here. What is your tale?[AN]
[....v.]
I'm on my way to the Tower[N]
of the Mods. While I can't[AN]
pay you at present, if you[N]
help me, I'll pay you big[AN]
bucks when the war is over.[AN]
[.v....]
Deal.[AN][X]

## Ch13Ending
[.v....][LoadVerge]
[....v.][LoadVedge]
Whew, I should work out in heat[N]
like this more often. Hard to[AN]
care about the intolerable heat[N]
when you're too busy fighting.[AN]
[.v....]
Milord, the exit[N]
is just ahead.[AN]
[....v.]
Let's go. The Tower[N]
of the Mods awaits![A][X]
