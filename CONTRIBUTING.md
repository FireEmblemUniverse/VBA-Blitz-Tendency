VBA:BT is meant to be a series of blitzes culminating in a finished blitz hack.
Anyone is free to contribute to any one of the blitzes, and
both I (the organizer) and the contributors must follow the following rules:

## Rules

1) Any insertable resource made will be in the final game.
 - Edits may be made to improve quality later.
 - Only up to so many submissions will be used. For example, if 40 maps are submitted, only the first 30 will be used.
 - All resources submitted should under a creative commons license, and will be available for public use post-blitz.

2) Strict version control will be used.
 - Adding any new assets must be done through a branch and pull request.
 - Each pull request should pass tests. See "Testing".
 - For consistency's sake, new lines will use '\n\r'.
 
3) Only open source assets will be used.
 - See subpoints on #1.

## Testing

1) ColorzCore should assemble the project without errors or warnings.
2) The game should boot and new games should transition into the first chapter without error.
3) The feature being added should appear to be functional.
